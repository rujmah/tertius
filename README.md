Tertius
=======

Tertius was one of Paul's scribes, who helped him write his words down.
Tertius the software package is two things: it's a Javascript library for
helping people to create rich client-side Bible study tools; it's also a
sample study tool created using the Tertius library.

Users

End users can use Tertius as a web-based application or as a mobile application.
The mobile application is much faster and more efficient, but the web app should
work everywhere.

Developers
----------

The idea behind Tertius is that you can use as little or as much of the library
as you need to put together the kind of applications that you want. You may only
want the code which provides access to Bible data; that's fine, go ahead. You may
just want the code which co-ordinates searching and retrieving and substitute in
your own data backend; again, no problem. You might even just want the reference
parser and the book information file. It's up to you. Tertius is provided under
the BSD 3-clause licence (see `LICENCE.md`) so you're free to modify it, build
on it or make commercial applications out of it although I would strongly encourage
you not to call those applications "Tertius", reserving that for the reference
implementation.

See `IMPLEMENTATION.md` and the various source code files to make sense of what
it does and why.
