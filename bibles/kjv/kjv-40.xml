<book num="Matt">
  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her <i>that had been the wife</i> of Urias;</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</verse>
    <verse num="12">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David <i>are</i> fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon <i>are</i> fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ <i>are</i> fourteen generations.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just <i>man,</i> and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</verse>
    <verse num="20">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</verse>
    <verse num="25">And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">When Herod the king had heard <i>these things,</i> he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</verse>
    <verse num="6">And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found <i>him,</i> bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</verse>
    <verse num="9">When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</verse>
    <verse num="10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="18">In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping <i>for</i> her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
    <verse num="19">But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
    <verse num="20">Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s life.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</verse>
    <verse num="2">And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</verse>
    <verse num="6">And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
    <verse num="8">Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</verse>
    <verse num="9">And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to <i>our</i> father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
    <verse num="11">I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and <i>with</i> fire:</verse>
    <verse num="12">Whose fan <i>is</i> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Jesus answering said unto him, <span class="j">Suffer <i>it to be so</i> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</span> Then he suffered him.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</verse>
    <verse num="17">And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But he answered and said, <span class="j">It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
    <verse num="6">And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in <i>their</i> hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Jesus said unto him, <span class="j">It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8">Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</verse>
    <verse num="9">And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then saith Jesus unto him, <span class="j">Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11">Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</verse>
    <verse num="13">And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</verse>
    <verse num="14">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="15">The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, <i>by</i> the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</verse>
    <verse num="16">The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</verse>
    <verse num="17">From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, <span class="j">Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="18">And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And he saith unto them, <span class="j">Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20">And they straightway left <i>their</i> nets, and followed him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James <i>the son</i> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and <i>from</i> Decapolis, and <i>from</i> Jerusalem, and <i>from</i> Judaea, and <i>from</i> beyond Jordan.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="3"><span class="j">Blessed <i>are</i> the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">Blessed <i>are</i> they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">Blessed <i>are</i> the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">Blessed <i>are</i> they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">Blessed <i>are</i> the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">Blessed <i>are</i> the pure in heart: for they shall see God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">Blessed <i>are</i> the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">Blessed <i>are</i> they which are persecuted for righteousness sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">Blessed are ye, when <i>men</i> shall revile you, and persecute <i>you,</i> and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great <i>is</i> your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach <i>them,</i> the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed <i>the righteousness</i> of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="21"><span class="j">Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: </span></verse>
    <verse num="22"><span class="j">But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. </span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast <i>it</i> from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not <i>that</i> thy whole body should be cast into hell. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not <i>that</i> thy whole body should be cast into hell. </span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="33"><span class="j">Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: </span></verse>
    <verse num="34"><span class="j">But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne: </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. </span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: </span></verse>
    <verse num="39"><span class="j">But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. </span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have <i>thy</i> cloke also. </span></verse>
    <verse num="41"><span class="j">And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. </span></verse>
    <verse num="42"><span class="j">Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="43"><span class="j">Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. </span></verse>
    <verse num="44"><span class="j">But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; </span></verse>
    <verse num="45"><span class="j">That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. </span></verse>
    <verse num="46"><span class="j">For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? </span></verse>
    <verse num="47"><span class="j">And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more <i>than others?</i> do not even the publicans so? </span></verse>
    <verse num="48"><span class="j">Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1"><span class="j">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="2"><span class="j">Therefore when thou doest <i>thine</i> alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. </span></verse>
    <verse num="3"><span class="j">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites <i>are:</i> for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen <i>do:</i> for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as <i>it is</i> in heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">Give us this day our daily bread. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: </span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: </span></verse>
    <verse num="21"><span class="j">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22"><span class="j">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. </span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great <i>is</i> that darkness! </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, <i>shall he</i> not much more <i>clothe</i> you, O ye of little faith? </span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? </span></verse>

    <verse num="1">When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Jesus put forth <i>his</i> hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="j">I will; be thou clean.</span> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="5">And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,</verse>
    <verse num="6">And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">I will come and heal him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8">The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this <i>man,</i> Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="10">When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> he marvelled, and said to them that followed, <span class="j">Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. </span></verse>

    <verse num="13">And Jesus said unto the centurion, <span class="j">Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="14">And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="16">When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with <i>his</i> word, and healed all that were sick:</verse>
    <verse num="17">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare <i>our</i> sicknesses.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air <i>have</i> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay <i>his</i> head. </span></verse>
    <verse num="21">And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</verse>

    <verse num="23">And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And his disciples came to <i>him,</i> and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And he saith unto them, <span class="j">Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27">But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</verse>
    <verse num="28">And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</verse>
    <verse num="30">And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
    <verse num="31">So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And he said unto them, <span class="j">Go.</span> And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought <i>him</i> that he would depart out of their coasts.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; <span class="j">Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. </span></verse>
    <verse num="3">And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This <i>man</i> blasphemeth.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, <span class="j">Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">For whether is easier, to say, <i>Thy</i> sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk? </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,</span> (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) <span class="j">Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7">And he arose, and departed to his house.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But when the multitudes saw <i>it,</i> they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, <span class="j">Follow me.</span> And he arose, and followed him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And when the Pharisees saw <i>it,</i> they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?</verse>
    <verse num="12">But when Jesus heard <i>that,</i> he said unto them, <span class="j">They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">But go ye and learn what <i>that</i> meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="14">Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. </span></verse>

    <verse num="18">While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Jesus arose, and followed him, and <i>so did</i> his disciples.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind <i>him,</i> and touched the hem of his garment:</verse>
    <verse num="21">For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, <span class="j">Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.</span> And the woman was made whole from that hour.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,</verse>
    <verse num="24">He said unto them, <span class="j">Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.</span> And they laughed him to scorn.</verse>
    <verse num="25">But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, <i>Thou</i> Son of David, have mercy on us.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Believe ye that I am able to do this?</span> They said unto him, Yea, Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then touched he their eyes, saying, <span class="j">According to your faith be it unto you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30">And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, <span class="j">See <i>that</i> no man know <i>it. </i></span></verse>
    <verse num="31">But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.</verse>
    <verse num="32">As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="34">But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</verse>
    <verse num="36">But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</verse>
    <verse num="37">Then saith he unto his disciples, <span class="j">The harvest truly <i>is</i> plenteous, but the labourers <i>are</i> few; </span></verse>

  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">And when he had called unto <i>him</i> his twelve disciples, he gave them power <i>against</i> unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</verse>

  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,</verse>
    <verse num="3">And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</verse>
    <verse num="4">Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. </span></verse>

    <verse num="9"><span class="j">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">For this is <i>he,</i> of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. </span></verse>

    <verse num="24"><span class="j">But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="25">At that time Jesus answered and said, <span class="j">I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and <i>he</i> to whomsoever the Son will reveal <i>him.</i> </span><span class="j"></span></verse>

  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.</verse>
    <verse num="2">But when the Pharisees saw <i>it,</i> they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But he said unto them, <span class="j">Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">But I say unto you, That in this place is <i>one</i> greater than the temple. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">But if ye had known what <i>this</i> meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9">And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:</verse>
    <verse num="10">And, behold, there was a man which had <i>his</i> hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he said unto them, <span class="j">What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift <i>it</i> out? </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13">Then saith he to the man, <span class="j">Stretch forth thine hand.</span> And he stretched <i>it</i> forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But when Jesus knew <i>it,</i> he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</verse>
    <verse num="16">And charged them that they should not make him known:</verse>
    <verse num="17">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="18">Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</verse>
    <verse num="19">He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</verse>
    <verse num="20">A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?</verse>
    <verse num="24">But when the Pharisees heard <i>it,</i> they said, This <i>fellow</i> doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, <span class="j">Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast <i>them</i> out? therefore they shall be your judges. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy <i>against</i> the <i>Holy</i> Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the <i>world</i> to come. </span></verse>
    <verse num="33"><span class="j">Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by <i>his</i> fruit. </span></verse>
    <verse num="34"><span class="j">O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. </span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="38">Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</verse>
    <verse num="39">But he answered and said unto them, <span class="j">An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: </span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="41"><span class="j">The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas <i>is</i> here. </span></verse>
    <verse num="42"><span class="j">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon <i>is</i> here. </span></verse>
    <verse num="43"><span class="j">When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. </span></verse>
    <verse num="44"><span class="j">Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth <i>it</i> empty, swept, and garnished. </span></verse>
    <verse num="45"><span class="j">Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last <i>state</i> of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="46">While he yet talked to the people, behold, <i>his</i> mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</verse>
    <verse num="47">Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="48">But he answered and said unto him that told him, <span class="j">Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? </span></verse>
    <verse num="49">And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, <span class="j">Behold my mother and my brethren! </span></verse>
    <verse num="50"><span class="j">For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, <span class="j">Behold, a sower went forth to sow; </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">And when he sowed, some <i>seeds</i> fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10">And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</verse>
    <verse num="11">He answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and <i>their</i> ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with <i>their</i> eyes, and hear with <i>their</i> ears, and should understand with <i>their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">But blessed <i>are</i> your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous <i>men</i> have desired to see <i>those things</i> which ye see, and have not seen <i>them;</i> and to hear <i>those things</i> which ye hear, and have not heard <i>them.</i> </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <i>it</i> not, then cometh the wicked <i>one,</i> and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; </span></verse>
    <verse num="21"><span class="j">Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22"><span class="j">He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. </span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth <i>it;</i> which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="24">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <span class="j">The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="31">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <span class="j">The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="33">Another parable spake he unto them; <span class="j">The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. </span></verse>
    <verse num="34">All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</verse>
    <verse num="35">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</verse>
    <verse num="37">He answered and said unto them, <span class="j">He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked <i>one; </i></span></verse>
    <verse num="39"><span class="j">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. </span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. </span></verse>
    <verse num="41"><span class="j">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; </span></verse>
    <verse num="42"><span class="j">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="43"><span class="j">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="44"><span class="j">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="45"><span class="j">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: </span></verse>
    <verse num="46"><span class="j">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="47"><span class="j">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: </span></verse>
    <verse num="48"><span class="j">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. </span></verse>
    <verse num="49"><span class="j">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, </span></verse>
    <verse num="50"><span class="j">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="51">Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Have ye understood all these things?</span> They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="52">Then said he unto them, <span class="j">Therefore every scribe <i>which is</i> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i>that is</i> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <i>things</i> new and old. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="53">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</verse>
    <verse num="54">And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this <i>man</i> this wisdom, and <i>these</i> mighty works?</verse>
    <verse num="55">Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</verse>
    <verse num="56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this <i>man</i> all these things?</verse>
    <verse num="57">And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. </span></verse>
    <verse num="58">And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="14">
    <verse num="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</verse>
    <verse num="2">And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put <i>him</i> in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist’s head in a charger.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded <i>it</i> to be given <i>her. </i></verse>
    <verse num="10">And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought <i>it</i> to her mother.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="13">When Jesus heard <i>of it,</i> he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard <i>thereof,</i> they followed him on foot out of the cities.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.</verse>
    <verse num="16">But Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">They need not depart; give ye them to eat. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17">And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.</verse>
    <verse num="18">He said, <span class="j">Bring them hither to me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to <i>his</i> disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</verse>
    <verse num="24">But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</verse>
    <verse num="27">But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, <span class="j">Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28">And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And he said, <span class="j">Come.</span> And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="30">But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And immediately Jesus stretched forth <i>his</i> hand, and caught him, and said unto him, <span class="j">O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? </span></verse>
    <verse num="32">And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;</verse>
    <verse num="36">And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="15">
    <verse num="1">Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But he answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to <i>his</i> father or <i>his</i> mother, <i>It is</i> a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">And honour not his father or his mother, <i>he shall be free.</i> Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j"><i>Ye</i> hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with <i>their</i> lips; but their heart is far from me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">But in vain they do worship me, teaching <i>for</i> doctrines the commandments of men. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="10">And he called the multitude, and said unto them, <span class="j">Hear, and understand: </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12">Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</verse>
    <verse num="13">But he answered and said, <span class="j">Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Jesus said, <span class="j">Are ye also yet without understanding? </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: </span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">These are <i>the things</i> which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</verse>
    <verse num="23">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</verse>
    <verse num="24">But he answered and said, <span class="j">I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</verse>
    <verse num="26">But he answered and said, <span class="j">It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast <i>it</i> to dogs. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="j">O woman, great <i>is</i> thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29">And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And great multitudes came unto him, having with them <i>those that were</i> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:</verse>
    <verse num="31">Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then Jesus called his disciples <i>unto him,</i> and said, <span class="j">I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. </span></verse>
    <verse num="33">And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</verse>
    <verse num="34">And Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake <i>them,</i> and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <i>meat</i> that was left seven baskets full.</verse>
    <verse num="38">And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="16">
    <verse num="1">The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He answered and said unto them, <span class="j">When it is evening, ye say, <i>It will be</i> fair weather: for the sky is red. </span></verse>
    <verse num="3"><span class="j">And in the morning, <i>It will be</i> foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O <i>ye</i> hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not <i>discern</i> the signs of the times? </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.</span> And he left them, and departed.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <i>It is</i> because we have taken no bread.</verse>
    <verse num="8"><i>Which</i> when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, <span class="j">O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">How is it that ye do not understand that I spake <i>it</i> not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? </span></verse>
    <verse num="12">Then understood they how that he bade <i>them</i> not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</verse>
    <verse num="13">When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span class="j">Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? </span></verse>
    <verse num="14">And they said, Some <i>say that thou art</i> John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</verse>
    <verse num="15">He saith unto them, <span class="j">But whom say ye that I am? </span></verse>
    <verse num="16">And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="j">Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed <i>it</i> unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20">Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="21">From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="23">But he turned, and said unto Peter, <span class="j">Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="24">Then said Jesus unto his disciples, <span class="j">If any <i>man</i> will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="17">
    <verse num="1">And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,</verse>
    <verse num="2">And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</verse>
    <verse num="5">While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And when the disciples heard <i>it,</i> they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Jesus came and touched them, and said, <span class="j">Arise, and be not afraid. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8">And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, <span class="j">Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10">And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13">Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a <i>certain</i> man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</verse>
    <verse num="15">Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Jesus answered and said, <span class="j">O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18">And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="21"><span class="j">Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="22">And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">And they shall kill him, and the
    third day he shall be raised again.</span> And they were exceeding sorry. 
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute <i>money</i> came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</verse>
    <verse num="25">He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, <span class="j">What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? </span></verse>
    <verse num="26">Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">Then are the children free. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="18">
    <verse num="1">At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</verse>
    <verse num="3">And said, <span class="j">Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and <i>that</i> he were drowned in the depth of the sea. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast <i>them</i> from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast <i>it</i> from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that <i>sheep,</i> than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">But if he will not hear <i>thee, then</i> take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell <i>it</i> unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="21">Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</verse>
    <verse num="22">Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took <i>him</i> by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. </span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: </span></verse>
    <verse num="33"><span class="j">Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? </span></verse>
    <verse num="34"><span class="j">And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;</verse>
    <verse num="2">And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Have ye not read, that he which made <i>them</i> at the beginning made them male and female, </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7">They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</verse>
    <verse num="8">He saith unto them, <span class="j">Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except <i>it be</i> for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="10">His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with <i>his</i> wife, it is not good to marry.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But he said unto them, <span class="j">All <i>men</i> cannot receive this saying, save <i>they</i> to whom it is given. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from <i>their</i> mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive <i>it,</i> let him receive <i>it.</i> </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="13">Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put <i>his</i> hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But Jesus said, <span class="j">Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15">And he laid <i>his</i> hands on them, and departed thence.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he said unto him, <span class="j">Why callest thou me good? <i>there is</i> none good but one, <i>that is,</i> God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18">He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, <span class="j">Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">Honour thy father and <i>thy</i> mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20">The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</verse>
    <verse num="21">Jesus said unto him, <span class="j">If thou wilt be perfect, go <i>and</i> sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come <i>and</i> follow me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22">But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then said Jesus unto his disciples, <span class="j">Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25">When his disciples heard <i>it,</i> they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</verse>
    <verse num="26">But Jesus beheld <i>them,</i> and said unto them, <span class="j">With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="27">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">But many <i>that are</i> first shall be last; and the last <i>shall be</i> first. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1"><span class="j">For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i>that is</i> an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. </span></verse>
    <verse num="2"><span class="j">And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. </span></verse>
    <verse num="3"><span class="j">And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, <i>that</i> shall ye receive. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them <i>their</i> hire, beginning from the last unto the first. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">And when they came that <i>were hired</i> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">Saying, These last have wrought <i>but</i> one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">Take <i>that</i> thine <i>is,</i> and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="17">And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,</verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify <i>him:</i> and the third day he shall rise again. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="20">Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping <i>him,</i> and desiring a certain thing of him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And he said unto her, <span class="j">What wilt thou?</span> She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But Jesus answered and said, <span class="j">Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span> They say unto him, We are able.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he saith unto them, <span class="j">Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but <i>it shall be given to them</i> for whom it is prepared of my Father. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24">And when the ten heard <i>it,</i> they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="25">But Jesus called them <i>unto him,</i> and said, <span class="j">Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29">And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, <span class="j">What will ye that I shall do unto you? </span></verse>
    <verse num="33">They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</verse>
    <verse num="34">So Jesus had compassion <i>on them,</i> and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Saying unto them, <span class="j">Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose <i>them,</i> and bring <i>them</i> unto me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="3"><span class="j">And if any <i>man</i> say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them. </span></verse>
    <verse num="4">All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="5">Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,</verse>
    <verse num="7">And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set <i>him</i> thereon.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed <i>them</i> in the way.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed <i>is</i> he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</verse>
    <verse num="13">And said unto them, <span class="j">It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14">And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,</verse>
    <verse num="16">And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="17">And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, <span class="j">Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.</span> And presently the fig tree withered away.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And when the disciples saw <i>it,</i> they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</verse>
    <verse num="21">Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this <i>which is done</i> to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22"><span class="j">And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="23">And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="j">I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? </span></verse>
    <verse num="26">But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, <span class="j">Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">But what think ye? A <i>certain</i> man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I <i>go,</i> sir: and went not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">Whether of them twain did the will of <i>his</i> father?</span> They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen <i>it,</i> repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="33"><span class="j">Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: </span></verse>
    <verse num="34"><span class="j">And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. </span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. </span></verse>
    <verse num="39"><span class="j">And they caught him, and cast <i>him</i> out of the vineyard, and slew <i>him. </i></span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? </span></verse>
    <verse num="41">They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out <i>his</i> vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</verse>
    <verse num="42">Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? </span></verse>
    <verse num="43"><span class="j">Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. </span></verse>
    <verse num="44"><span class="j">And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. </span></verse>
    <verse num="45">And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</verse>
    <verse num="46">But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</verse>
    <verse num="2"><span class="j">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, </span></verse>
    <verse num="3"><span class="j">And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and <i>my</i> fatlings <i>are</i> killed, and all things <i>are</i> ready: come unto the marriage. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">But they made light of <i>it,</i> and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">And the remnant took his servants, and entreated <i>them</i> spitefully, and slew <i>them. </i></span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">But when the king heard <i>thereof,</i> he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast <i>him</i> into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">For many are called, but few <i>are</i> chosen. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="15">Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in <i>his</i> talk.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any <i>man:</i> for thou regardest not the person of men.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</verse>
    <verse num="18">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, <span class="j">Why tempt ye me, <i>ye</i> hypocrites? </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">Shew me the tribute money.</span> And they brought unto him a penny.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he saith unto them, <span class="j">Whose <i>is</i> this image and superscription? </span></verse>
    <verse num="21">They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, <span class="j">Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22">When they had heard <i>these words,</i> they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</verse>
    <verse num="23">The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</verse>
    <verse num="24">Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</verse>
    <verse num="26">Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And last of all the woman died also.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. </span></verse>
    <verse num="33">And when the multitude heard <i>this,</i> they were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>
    <verse num="34">But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Then one of them, <i>which was</i> a lawyer, asked <i>him a question, </i>tempting him, and saying,</verse>
    <verse num="36">Master, which <i>is</i> the great commandment in the law?</verse>
    <verse num="37">Jesus said unto him, <span class="j">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">This is the first and great commandment. </span></verse>
    <verse num="39"><span class="j">And the second <i>is</i> like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. </span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="41">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</verse>
    <verse num="42">Saying, <span class="j">What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, <i>The Son</i> of David. </span></verse>
    <verse num="43">He saith unto them, <span class="j">How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, </span></verse>
    <verse num="44"><span class="j">The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? </span></verse>
    <verse num="45"><span class="j">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? </span></verse>
    <verse num="46">And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any <i>man</i> from that day forth ask him any more <i>questions.</i></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="23">
    <verse num="1">Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Saying, <span class="j">The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat: </span></verse>
    <verse num="3"><span class="j">All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, <i>that</i> observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay <i>them</i> on men’s shoulders; but they <i>themselves</i> will not move them with one of their fingers. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, <i>even</i> Christ; and all ye are brethren. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">And call no <i>man</i> your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, <i>even</i> Christ. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in <i>yourselves,</i> neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">Woe unto you, <i>ye</i> blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor! </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j"><i>Ye</i> fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j"><i>Ye</i> fools and blind: for whether <i>is</i> greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? </span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. </span></verse>
    <verse num="21"><span class="j">And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22"><span class="j">And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. </span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier <i>matters</i> of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j"><i>Ye</i> blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j"><i>Thou</i> blind Pharisee, cleanse first that <i>which is</i> within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead <i>men’s</i> bones, and of all uncleanness. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. </span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. </span></verse>

    <verse num="35"><span class="j">That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. </span></verse>

    <verse num="25"><span class="j">Behold, I have told you before. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, <i>he is</i> in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe <i>it</i> not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. </span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: </span></verse>
    <verse num="33"><span class="j">So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, <i>even</i> at the doors. </span></verse>
    <verse num="34"><span class="j">Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man,</i> no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">But as the days of Noe <i>were,</i> so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, </span></verse>
    <verse num="39"><span class="j">And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. </span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. </span></verse>
    <verse num="41"><span class="j">Two <i>women shall be</i> grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="42"><span class="j">Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. </span></verse>
    <verse num="43"><span class="j">But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. </span></verse>

  <chapter num="25">
    <verse num="1"><span class="j">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. </span></verse>
    <verse num="2"><span class="j">And five of them were wise, and five <i>were</i> foolish. </span></verse>
    <verse num="3"><span class="j">They that <i>were</i> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so;</i> lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">For <i>the kingdom of heaven is</i> as a man travelling into a far country, <i>who</i> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <i>them</i> other five talents. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">And likewise he that <i>had received</i> two, he also gained other two. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. </span></verse>
    <verse num="21"><span class="j">His lord said unto him, Well done, <i>thou</i> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22"><span class="j">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. </span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i>there</i> thou hast <i>that is</i> thine. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">His lord answered and said unto him, <i>Thou</i> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i>then</i> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">Take therefore the talent from him, and give <i>it</i> unto him which hath ten talents. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i>his</i> sheep from the goats: </span></verse>
    <verse num="33"><span class="j">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. </span></verse>
    <verse num="34"><span class="j">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: </span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed <i>thee?</i> or thirsty, and gave <i>thee</i> drink? </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">When saw we thee a stranger, and took <i>thee</i> in? or naked, and clothed <i>thee? </i></span></verse>
    <verse num="39"><span class="j">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? </span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <i>it</i> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <i>it</i> unto me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="41"><span class="j">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: </span></verse>
    <verse num="42"><span class="j">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: </span></verse>
    <verse num="43"><span class="j">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="44"><span class="j">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? </span></verse>
    <verse num="45"><span class="j">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did <i>it</i> not to one of the least of these, ye did <i>it</i> not to me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="46"><span class="j">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="26">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</verse>
    <verse num="2"><span class="j">Ye know that after two days is <i>the feast of</i> the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. </span></verse>
    <verse num="3">Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
    <verse num="4">And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill <i>him. </i></verse>
    <verse num="5">But they said, Not on the feast <i>day,</i> lest there be an uproar among the people.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
    <verse num="7">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat <i>at meat. </i></verse>
    <verse num="8">But when his disciples saw <i>it,</i> they had indignation, saying, To what purpose <i>is</i> this waste?</verse>
    <verse num="9">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</verse>
    <verse num="10">When Jesus understood <i>it,</i> he said unto them, <span class="j">Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did <i>it</i> for my burial. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, <i>there</i> shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="14">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</verse>
    <verse num="15">And said <i>unto them,</i> What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Now the first <i>day</i> of the <i>feast of</i> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he said, <span class="j">Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19">And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And as they did eat, he said, <span class="j">Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he answered and said, <span class="j">He that dippeth <i>his</i> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, <span class="j">Thou hast said. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed <i>it,</i> and brake <i>it,</i> and gave <i>it</i> to the disciples, and said, <span class="j">Take, eat; this is my body. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, <span class="j">Drink ye all of it; </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then saith Jesus unto them, <span class="j">All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. </span></verse>
    <verse num="33">Peter answered and said unto him, Though all <i>men</i> shall be offended because of thee, <i>yet</i> will I never be offended.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Jesus said unto him, <span class="j">Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, <span class="j">Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</verse>
    <verse num="38">Then saith he unto them, <span class="j">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="39">And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="j">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <i>wilt. </i></span></verse>
    <verse num="40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, <span class="j">What, could ye not watch with me one hour? </span></verse>
    <verse num="41"><span class="j">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak. </span></verse>
    <verse num="42">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, <span class="j">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. </span></verse>
    <verse num="43">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
    <verse num="44">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
    <verse num="45">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, <span class="j">Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span></verse>
    <verse num="46"><span class="j">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="47">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
    <verse num="48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</verse>
    <verse num="49">And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</verse>
    <verse num="50">And Jesus said unto him, <span class="j">Friend, wherefore art thou come?</span> Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</verse>
    <verse num="51">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <i>his</i> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.</verse>
    <verse num="52">Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="j">Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. </span></verse>
    <verse num="53"><span class="j">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? </span></verse>
    <verse num="54"><span class="j">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? </span></verse>
    <verse num="55">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, <span class="j">Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="56"><span class="j">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. </span>Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</verse>
    <verse num="57">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <i>him</i> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</verse>
    <verse num="58">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</verse>
    <verse num="59">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</verse>
    <verse num="60">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <i>yet</i> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</verse>
    <verse num="61">And said, This <i>fellow</i> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</verse>
    <verse num="62">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what <i>is it which</i> these witness against thee?</verse>
    <verse num="63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
    <verse num="64">Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
    <verse num="66">What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</verse>
    <verse num="67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote <i>him</i> with the palms of their hands,</verse>
    <verse num="68">Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</verse>
    <verse num="69">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>
    <verse num="70">But he denied before <i>them</i> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</verse>
    <verse num="71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another <i>maid</i> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This <i>fellow</i> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
    <verse num="72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</verse>
    <verse num="73">And after a while came unto <i>him</i> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art <i>one</i> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</verse>
    <verse num="74">Then began he to curse and to swear, <i>saying,</i> I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</verse>
    <verse num="75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, <span class="j">Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> And he went out, and wept bitterly.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="27">
    <verse num="1">When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</verse>
    <verse num="2">And when they had bound him, they led <i>him</i> away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Judas, which had betrayeth him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
    <verse num="4">Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What <i>is that</i> to us? see thou <i>to that. </i></verse>
    <verse num="5">And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</verse>
    <verse num="10">And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, <span class="j">Thou sayest. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12">And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now at <i>that</i> feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</verse>
    <verse num="18">For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</verse>
    <verse num="19">When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="21">The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? <i>They</i> all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</verse>
    <verse num="24">When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but <i>that</i> rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed <i>his</i> hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye <i>to it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="25">Then answered all the people, and said, His blood <i>be</i> on us, and on our children.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered <i>him</i> to be crucified.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band <i>of soldiers. </i></verse>
    <verse num="28">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put <i>it</i> upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
    <verse num="30">And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify <i>him. </i></verse>
    <verse num="32">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</verse>
    <verse num="34">They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted <i>thereof,</i> he would not drink.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And sitting down they watched him there;</verse>
    <verse num="37">And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
    <verse num="38">Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</verse>
    <verse num="40">And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <i>it</i> in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</verse>
    <verse num="41">Likewise also the chief priests mocking <i>him,</i> with the scribes and elders, said,</verse>
    <verse num="42">He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</verse>
    <verse num="43">He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</verse>
    <verse num="44">The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</verse>
    <verse num="45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</verse>
    <verse num="46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="j">Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</span> that is to say, <span class="j">My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? </span></verse>
    <verse num="47">Some of them that stood there, when they heard <i>that,</i> said, This <i>man</i> calleth for Elias.</verse>
    <verse num="48">And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled <i>it</i> with vinegar, and put <i>it</i> on a reed, and gave him to drink.</verse>
    <verse num="49">The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</verse>
    <verse num="50">Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</verse>
    <verse num="51">And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</verse>
    <verse num="52">And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</verse>
    <verse num="53">And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</verse>
    <verse num="54">Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</verse>
    <verse num="55">And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</verse>
    <verse num="56">Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.</verse>
    <verse num="57">When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:</verse>
    <verse num="58">He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</verse>
    <verse num="59">And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
    <verse num="60">And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</verse>
    <verse num="61">And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</verse>
    <verse num="62">Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</verse>
    <verse num="63">Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, <span class="j">After three days I will rise again. </span></verse>
    <verse num="64">Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</verse>
    <verse num="65">Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make <i>it</i> as sure as ye can.</verse>
    <verse num="66">So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</verse>

  <chapter num="28">
    <verse num="1">In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first <i>day</i> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</verse>
    <verse num="3">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</verse>
    <verse num="4">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <i>men. </i></verse>
    <verse num="5">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</verse>
    <verse num="6">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class="j">All hail.</span> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="j">Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="11">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</verse>
    <verse num="13">Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <i>away</i> while we slept.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <span class="j">All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: </span></verse>
