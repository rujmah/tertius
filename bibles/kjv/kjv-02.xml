  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">Now these <i>are</i> the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</verse>
    <verse num="3">Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</verse>
    <verse num="4">Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt <i>already. </i></verse>
    <verse num="6">And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel <i>are</i> more and mightier than we:</verse>
    <verse num="10">Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and <i>so</i> get them up out of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</verse>
    <verse num="12">But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, <i>was</i> with rigour.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one <i>was</i> Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see <i>them</i> upon the stools; if it <i>be</i> a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it <i>be</i> a daughter, then she shall live.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women <i>are</i> not as the Egyptian women; for they <i>are</i> lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took <i>to wife</i> a daughter of Levi.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he <i>was a</i> goodly <i>child,</i> she hid him three months.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid <i>it</i> in the flags by the river’s brink.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash <i>herself</i> at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And when she had opened <i>it,</i> she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This <i>is one</i> of the Hebrews’ children.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give <i>thee</i> thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that <i>there was</i> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew <i>water,</i> and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How <i>is it that</i> ye are come so soon to day?</verse>
    <verse num="19">And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew <i>water</i> enough for us, and watered the flock.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he said unto his daughters, And where <i>is</i> he? why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And she bare <i>him</i> a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto <i>them.</i></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, <i>even</i> to Horeb.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush <i>was</i> not consumed.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here <i>am</i> I.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Moreover he said, I <i>am</i> the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which <i>are</i> in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Moses said unto God, Who <i>am</i> I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this <i>shall be</i> a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Moses said unto God, Behold, <i>when</i> I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</verse>
    <verse num="14">And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this <i>is</i> my name for ever, and this <i>is</i> my memorial unto all generations.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and <i>seen</i> that which is done to you in Egypt:</verse>
    <verse num="17">And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:</verse>
    <verse num="22">But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put <i>them</i> upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the LORD said unto him, What <i>is</i> that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</verse>
    <verse num="5">That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand <i>was</i> leprous as snow.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his <i>other</i> flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour <i>it</i> upon the dry <i>land:</i> and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry <i>land.</i></verse>
    <verse num="10">And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I <i>am</i> not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I <i>am</i> slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand <i>of him whom</i> thou wilt send.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, <i>Is</i> not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, <i>even</i> he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which <i>are</i> in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel <i>is</i> my son, <i>even</i> my firstborn:</verse>
    <verse num="23">And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, <i>even</i> thy firstborn.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast <i>it</i> at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband <i>art</i> thou to me.</verse>
    <verse num="26">So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband <i>thou art,</i> because of the circumcision.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Pharaoh said, Who <i>is</i> the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now <i>are</i> many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="7">Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish <i>ought</i> thereof: for they <i>be</i> idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go <i>and</i> sacrifice to our God.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the taskmasters hasted <i>them,</i> saying, Fulfil your works, <i>your</i> daily tasks, as when there was straw.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, <i>and</i> demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?</verse>
    <verse num="16">There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants <i>are</i> beaten; but the fault <i>is</i> in thine own people.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But he said, Ye <i>are</i> idle, <i>ye are</i> idle: therefore ye say, Let us go <i>and</i> do sacrifice to the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Go therefore now, <i>and</i> work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the officers of the children of Israel did see <i>that</i> they <i>were</i> in evil <i>case,</i> after it was said, Ye shall not minish <i>ought</i> from your bricks of your daily task.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</verse>
    <verse num="21">And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou <i>so</i> evil entreated this people? why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> thou hast sent me?</verse>
    <verse num="23">For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I <i>am</i> the LORD:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by <i>the name of</i> God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I <i>am</i> the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:</verse>
    <verse num="7">And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="11">Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who <i>am</i> of uncircumcised lips?</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="14">These <i>be</i> the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these <i>be</i> the families of Reuben.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these <i>are</i> the families of Simeon.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi <i>were</i> an hundred thirty and seven years.</verse>
    <verse num="17">The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath <i>were</i> an hundred thirty and three years.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these <i>are</i> the families of Levi according to their generations.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram <i>were</i> an hundred and thirty and seven years.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these <i>are</i> the families of the Korhites.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him <i>one</i> of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these <i>are</i> the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.</verse>
    <verse num="26">These <i>are</i> that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.</verse>
    <verse num="27">These <i>are</i> they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these <i>are</i> that Moses and Aaron.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And it came to pass on the day <i>when</i> the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,</verse>
    <verse num="29">That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I <i>am</i> the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I <i>am</i> of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, <i>and</i> my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the Egyptians shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Moses <i>was</i> fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast <i>it</i> before Pharaoh, <i>and</i> it shall become a serpent.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart <i>is</i> hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that <i>is</i> in mine hand upon the waters which <i>are</i> in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the fish that <i>is</i> in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and <i>that</i> there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in <i>vessels of</i> wood, and in <i>vessels of</i> stone.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that <i>were</i> in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that <i>were</i> in the river were turned to blood.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the fish that <i>was</i> in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.</verse>

  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And if thou refuse to let <i>them</i> go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, <i>that</i> they may remain in the river only?</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he said, To morrow. And he said, <i>Be it</i> according to thy word: that thou mayest know that <i>there is</i> none like unto the LORD our God.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This <i>is</i> the finger of God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms <i>of flies</i> upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms <i>of flies,</i> and also the ground whereon they <i>are. </i></verse>
    <verse num="22">And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms <i>of flies</i> shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I <i>am</i> the LORD in the midst of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm <i>of flies</i> into the house of Pharaoh, and <i>into</i> his servants’ houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm <i>of flies.</i></verse>
    <verse num="25">And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?</verse>
    <verse num="27">We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms <i>of flies</i> may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms <i>of flies</i> from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.</verse>

  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>

    <verse num="3">Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which <i>is</i> in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: <i>there shall be</i> a very grievous murrain.</verse>

    <verse num="5">And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</verse>

    <verse num="12">And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>

    <verse num="15">For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And in very deed for this <i>cause</i> have I raised thee up, for to shew <i>in</i> thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="17">As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?</verse>
    <verse num="18">Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Send therefore now, <i>and</i> gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; <i>for upon</i> every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.</verse>
    <verse num="20">He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:</verse>

    <verse num="23">And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="24">So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that <i>was</i> in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.</verse>

    <verse num="29">And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; <i>and</i> the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth <i>is</i> the LORD’S.</verse>
    <verse num="30">But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax <i>was</i> bolled.</verse>

    <verse num="33">And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.</verse>

  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:</verse>

    <verse num="3">And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:</verse>
    <verse num="6">And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: <i>but</i> who <i>are</i> they that shall go?</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we <i>must hold</i> a feast unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look <i>to it;</i> for evil <i>is</i> before you.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Not so: go now ye <i>that are</i> men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, <i>even</i> all that the hail hath left.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all <i>that</i> night; <i>and</i> when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous <i>were they;</i> before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.</verse>

    <verse num="23">They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.</verse>

    <verse num="27">But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in <i>that</i> day thou seest my face thou shalt die.</verse>

  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="3">Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth <i>day</i> of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of <i>their</i> fathers, a lamb for an house:</verse>
    <verse num="4">And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take <i>it</i> according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take <i>it</i> out from the sheep, or from the goats:</verse>
    <verse num="6">And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And they shall take of the blood, and strike <i>it</i> on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; <i>and</i> with bitter <i>herbs</i> they shall eat it.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast <i>with</i> fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And thus shall ye eat it; <i>with</i> your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it <i>is</i> the LORD’S passover.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye <i>are:</i> and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy <i>you,</i> when I smite the land of Egypt.</verse>

    <verse num="15">Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And in the first day <i>there shall be</i> an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save <i>that</i> which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.</verse>

    <verse num="28">And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that <i>was</i> in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for <i>there was</i> not a house where <i>there was</i> not one dead.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, <i>and</i> get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We <i>be</i> all dead <i>men. </i></verse>

    <verse num="35">And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:</verse>

    <verse num="39">And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.</verse>
    <verse num="40">Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, <i>was</i> four hundred and thirty years.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="42">It <i>is</i> a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this <i>is</i> that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.</verse>
    <verse num="43">And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This <i>is</i> the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:</verse>
    <verse num="44">But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="45">A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="46">In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="47">All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</verse>
    <verse num="48">And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="49">One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</verse>
    <verse num="50">Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</verse>
    <verse num="51">And it came to pass the selfsame day, <i>that</i> the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, <i>both</i> of man and of beast: it <i>is</i> mine.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this <i>place:</i> there shall no leavened bread be eaten.</verse>
    <verse num="4">This day came ye out in the month Abib.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day <i>shall be</i> a feast to the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, <i>This is done</i> because of that <i>which</i> the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD’S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,</verse>
    <verse num="12">That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males <i>shall be</i> the LORD’S.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What <i>is</i> this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not <i>through</i> the way of the land of the Philistines, although that <i>was</i> near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:</verse>
    <verse num="18">But God led the people about, <i>through</i> the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:</verse>
    <verse num="22">He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, <i>from</i> before the people.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="14">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They <i>are</i> entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I <i>am</i> the LORD. And they did so.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses <i>and</i> chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And they said unto Moses, Because <i>there were</i> no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</verse>
    <verse num="12"><i>Is</i> not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For <i>it had been</i> better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</verse>
    <verse num="14">The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:</verse>
    <verse num="16">But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry <i>ground</i> through the midst of the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the Egyptians shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:</verse>
    <verse num="20">And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness <i>to them,</i> but it gave light by night <i>to these:</i> so that the one came not near the other all the night.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go <i>back</i> by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry <i>land,</i> and the waters were divided.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry <i>ground:</i> and the waters <i>were</i> a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, <i>even</i> all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,</verse>
    <verse num="25">And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, <i>and</i> all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.</verse>
    <verse num="29">But the children of Israel walked upon dry <i>land</i> in the midst of the sea; and the waters <i>were</i> a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="15">
    <verse num="1">Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The LORD <i>is</i> my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he <i>is</i> my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father’s God, and I will exalt him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The LORD <i>is</i> a man of war: the LORD <i>is</i> his name.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.</verse>
    <verse num="5">The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, <i>which</i> consumed them as stubble.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, <i>and</i> the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="9">The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Who <i>is</i> like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who <i>is</i> like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful <i>in</i> praises, doing wonders?</verse>
    <verse num="12">Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people <i>which</i> thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided <i>them</i> in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.</verse>
    <verse num="14">The people shall hear, <i>and</i> be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be <i>as</i> still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, <i>which</i> thou hast purchased.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, <i>in</i> the place, O LORD, <i>which</i> thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, <i>which</i> thy hands have established.</verse>
    <verse num="18">The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.</verse>
    <verse num="19">For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry <i>land</i> in the midst of the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="22">So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they <i>were</i> bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?</verse>
    <verse num="25">And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, <i>which</i> when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,</verse>
    <verse num="26">And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I <i>am</i> the LORD that healeth thee.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And they came to Elim, where <i>were</i> twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="16">
    <verse num="1">And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which <i>is</i> between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, <i>and</i> when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare <i>that</i> which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:</verse>
    <verse num="7">And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what <i>are</i> we, that ye murmur against us?</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Moses said, <i>This shall be,</i> when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what <i>are</i> we? your murmurings <i>are</i> not against us, but against the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="12">I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness <i>there lay</i> a small round thing, <i>as</i> small as the hoar frost on the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when the children of Israel saw <i>it,</i> they said one to another, It <i>is</i> manna: for they wist not what it <i>was.</i> And Moses said unto them, This <i>is</i> the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.</verse>
    <verse num="16">This <i>is</i> the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man <i>according to</i> his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for <i>them</i> which <i>are</i> in his tents.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And when they did mete <i>it</i> with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one <i>man:</i> and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he said unto them, This <i>is that</i> which the LORD hath said, To morrow <i>is</i> the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake <i>that</i> which ye will bake <i>to day,</i> and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day <i>is</i> a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, <i>which is</i> the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> there went out <i>some</i> of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?</verse>
    <verse num="29">See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</verse>
    <verse num="30">So the people rested on the seventh day.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it <i>was</i> like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it <i>was</i> like wafers <i>made</i> with honey.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And Moses said, This <i>is</i> the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.</verse>
    <verse num="34">As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Now an omer <i>is</i> the tenth <i>part</i> of an ephah.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="17">
    <verse num="1">And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and <i>there was</i> no water for the people to drink.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</verse>
    <verse num="12">But Moses’ hands <i>were</i> heavy; and they took a stone, and put <i>it</i> under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this <i>for</i> a memorial in a book, and rehearse <i>it</i> in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi:</verse>
    <verse num="16">For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn <i>that</i> the LORD <i>will have</i> war with Amalek from generation to generation.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="18">
    <verse num="1">When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, <i>and</i> that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;</verse>

    <verse num="3">And her two sons; of which the name of the one <i>was</i> Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:</verse>

    <verse num="5">And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of <i>their</i> welfare; and they came into the tent.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, <i>and</i> all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and <i>how</i> the LORD delivered them.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Jethro said, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Now I know that the LORD <i>is</i> greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly <i>he was</i> above them.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What <i>is</i> this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:</verse>
    <verse num="16">When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make <i>them</i> know the statutes of God, and his laws.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest <i>is</i> not good.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that <i>is</i> with thee: for this thing <i>is</i> too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:</verse>
    <verse num="20">And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place <i>such</i> over them, <i>to be</i> rulers of thousands, <i>and</i> rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</verse>
    <verse num="22">And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, <i>that</i> every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear <i>the burden</i> with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="23">If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee <i>so,</i> then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</verse>
    <verse num="24">So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</verse>

  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they <i>into</i> the wilderness of Sinai.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come <i>to</i> the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;</verse>
    <verse num="4">Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and <i>how</i> I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth <i>is</i> mine:</verse>
    <verse num="6">And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These <i>are</i> the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,</verse>
    <verse num="11">And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, <i>that ye</i> go <i>not</i> up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:</verse>
    <verse num="13">There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether <i>it be</i> beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at <i>your</i> wives.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that <i>was</i> in the camp trembled.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses <i>up</i> to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.</verse>
    <verse num="25">So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">And God spake all these words, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness <i>of any thing</i> that <i>is</i> in heaven above, or that <i>is</i> in the earth beneath, or that <i>is</i> in the water under the earth:</verse>
    <verse num="5">Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God <i>am</i> a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <i>generation</i> of them that hate me;</verse>
    <verse num="6">And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</verse>
    <verse num="10">But the seventh day <i>is</i> the sabbath of the LORD thy God: <i>in it</i> thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that <i>is</i> within thy gates:</verse>
    <verse num="11">For <i>in</i> six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them <i>is,</i> and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Thou shalt not kill.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Thou shalt not steal.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that <i>is</i> thy neighbour’s.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw <i>it,</i> they removed, and stood afar off.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God <i>was.</i></verse>
    <verse num="22">And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.</verse>
    <verse num="24">An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">Now these <i>are</i> the judgments which thou shalt set before them.</verse>
    <verse num="2">If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</verse>
    <verse num="3">If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.</verse>
    <verse num="8">If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="10">If he take him another <i>wife;</i> her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.</verse>
    <verse num="12">He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver <i>him</i> into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with <i>his</i> fist, and he die not, but keepeth <i>his</i> bed:</verse>
    <verse num="19">If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote <i>him</i> be quit: only he shall pay <i>for</i> the loss of his time, and shall cause <i>him</i> to be thoroughly healed.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he <i>is</i> his money.</verse>
    <verse num="22">If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart <i>from her,</i> and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges <i>determine. </i></verse>
    <verse num="23">And if <i>any</i> mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,</verse>
    <verse num="24">Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</verse>
    <verse num="25">Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth, or his maidservant’s tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.</verse>
    <verse num="28">If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox <i>shall be</i> quit.</verse>
    <verse num="29">But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.</verse>
    <verse num="30">If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="32">If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;</verse>
    <verse num="34">The owner of the pit shall make <i>it</i> good, <i>and</i> give money unto the owner of them; and the dead <i>beast</i> shall be his.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead <i>ox</i> also they shall divide.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</verse>
    <verse num="2">If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, <i>there shall</i> no blood <i>be shed</i> for him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">If the sun be risen upon him, <i>there shall be</i> blood <i>shed</i> for him; <i>for</i> he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</verse>
    <verse num="4">If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.</verse>
    <verse num="5">If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</verse>
    <verse num="6">If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed <i>therewith;</i> he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</verse>
    <verse num="7">If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.</verse>
    <verse num="8">If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, <i>to see</i> whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For all manner of trespass, <i>whether it be</i> for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, <i>or</i> for any manner of lost thing, which <i>another</i> challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; <i>and</i> whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.</verse>
    <verse num="10">If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing <i>it: </i></verse>
    <verse num="11"><i>Then</i> shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods; and the owner of it shall accept <i>thereof,</i> and he shall not make <i>it</i> good.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="13">If it be torn in pieces, <i>then</i> let him bring it <i>for</i> witness, <i>and</i> he shall not make good that which was torn.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And if a man borrow <i>ought</i> of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof <i>being</i> not with it, he shall surely make <i>it</i> good.</verse>
    <verse num="15"><i>But</i> if the owner thereof <i>be</i> with it, he shall not make <i>it</i> good: if it <i>be</i> an hired <i>thing,</i> it came for his hire.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</verse>
    <verse num="17">If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</verse>
    <verse num="20">He that sacrificeth unto <i>any</i> god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</verse>
    <verse num="23">If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;</verse>
    <verse num="24">And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</verse>
    <verse num="25">If thou lend money to <i>any of</i> my people <i>that is</i> poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.</verse>
    <verse num="26">If thou at all take thy neighbour’s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:</verse>
    <verse num="27">For that <i>is</i> his covering only, it <i>is</i> his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I <i>am</i> gracious.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Thou shalt not delay <i>to offer</i> the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, <i>and</i> with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat <i>any</i> flesh <i>that is</i> torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="23">
    <verse num="1">Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thou shalt not follow a multitude to <i>do</i> evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest <i>judgment:</i></verse>
    <verse num="3">Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.</verse>
    <verse num="4">If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.</verse>
    <verse num="5">If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:</verse>
    <verse num="11">But the seventh <i>year</i> thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, <i>and</i> with thy oliveyard.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And in all <i>things</i> that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, <i>which is</i> in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.</verse>
    <verse num="19">The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name <i>is</i> in him.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.</verse>
    <verse num="23">For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.</verse>
    <verse num="26">There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.</verse>
    <verse num="27">I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.</verse>
    <verse num="29">I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.</verse>
    <verse num="30">By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.</verse>
    <verse num="33">They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.</verse>

    <verse num="1">And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Moses took half of the blood, and put <i>it</i> in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.</verse>

    <verse num="11">And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.</verse>

    <verse num="22">Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the <i>caul</i> above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that <i>is</i> upon them, and the right shoulder; for it <i>is</i> a ram of consecration:</verse>

    <verse num="28">And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’ by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it <i>is</i> an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, <i>even</i> their heave offering unto the LORD.</verse>

    <verse num="38">Now this <i>is that</i> which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.</verse>
    <verse num="39">The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:</verse>
    <verse num="40">And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine <i>for</i> a drink offering.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</verse>

  <chapter num="32">
    <verse num="1">And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for <i>as for</i> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which <i>are</i> in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring <i>them</i> unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And all the people brake off the golden earrings which <i>were</i> in their ears, and brought <i>them</i> unto Aaron.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he received <i>them</i> at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These <i>be</i> thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And when Aaron saw <i>it,</i> he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow <i>is</i> a feast to the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted <i>themselves: </i></verse>
    <verse num="8">They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These <i>be</i> thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it <i>is</i> a stiffnecked people:</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?</verse>
    <verse num="12">Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit <i>it</i> for ever.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony <i>were</i> in his hand: the tables <i>were</i> written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other <i>were</i> they written.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the tables <i>were</i> the work of God, and the writing <i>was</i> the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, <i>There is</i> a noise of war in the camp.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he said, <i>It is</i> not the voice of <i>them that</i> shout for mastery, neither <i>is it</i> the voice of <i>them that</i> cry for being overcome: <i>but</i> the noise of <i>them that</i> sing do I hear.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt <i>it</i> in the fire, and ground <i>it</i> to powder, and strawed <i>it</i> upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink <i>of it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="21">And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are <i>set</i> on mischief.</verse>
    <verse num="23">For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for <i>as for</i> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break <i>it</i> off. So they gave <i>it</i> me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And when Moses saw that the people <i>were</i> naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto <i>their</i> shame among their enemies:)</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who <i>is</i> on the LORD’S side? <i>let him come</i> unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, <i>and</i> go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</verse>
    <verse num="29">For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Therefore now go, lead the people unto <i>the place</i> of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="33">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, <i>and</i> go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:</verse>
    <verse num="2">And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:</verse>
    <verse num="3">Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou <i>art</i> a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye <i>are</i> a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, <i>that</i> every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which <i>was</i> without the camp.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, <i>that</i> all the people rose up, and stood every man <i>at</i> his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle, and <i>the</i> LORD talked with Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand <i>at</i> the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man <i>in</i> his tent door.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation <i>is</i> thy people.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he said, My presence shall go <i>with thee,</i> and I will give thee rest.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he said unto him, If thy presence go not <i>with me,</i> carry us not up hence.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? <i>is it</i> not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the LORD said, Behold, <i>there is</i> a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:</verse>
    <verse num="22">And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:</verse>

    <verse num="21">And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And he made the robe of the ephod <i>of</i> woven work, all <i>of</i> blue.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And <i>there was</i> an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, <i>with</i> a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and scarlet, <i>and</i> twined <i>linen. </i></verse>
    <verse num="25">And they made bells <i>of</i> pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;</verse>
    <verse num="26">A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister <i>in;</i> as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And they made coats <i>of</i> fine linen <i>of</i> woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,</verse>
    <verse num="28">And a mitre <i>of</i> fine linen, and goodly bonnets <i>of</i> fine linen, and linen breeches <i>of</i> fine twined linen,</verse>
    <verse num="29">And a girdle <i>of</i> fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, <i>of</i> needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And they made the plate of the holy crown <i>of</i> pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, <i>like to</i> the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten <i>it</i> on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,</verse>
    <verse num="34">And the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers’ skins, and the vail of the covering,</verse>
    <verse num="35">The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,</verse>
    <verse num="36">The table, <i>and</i> all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,</verse>
    <verse num="37">The pure candlestick, <i>with</i> the lamps thereof, <i>even with</i> the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,</verse>
    <verse num="38">And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,</verse>
    <verse num="39">The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,</verse>
    <verse num="40">The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,</verse>
    <verse num="41">The cloths of service to do service in the holy <i>place,</i> and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons’ garments, to minister in the priest’s office.</verse>
    <verse num="42">According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.</verse>
    <verse num="43">And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they have done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.</verse>

  <chapter num="40">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that <i>is</i> therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> the tabernacle was reared up.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:</verse>
    <verse num="21">And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:</verse>
    <verse num="27">And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And he set up the hanging <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And he put the altar of burnt offering <i>by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash <i>withal. </i></verse>
    <verse num="31">And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:</verse>
    <verse num="32">When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:</verse>
    <verse num="37">But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.</verse>
