    <verse num="1">Blessed <i>is</i> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. </verse>

    <verse num="1">Give ear, O my people, <i>to</i> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. </verse>
    <verse num="2">I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: </verse>
    <verse num="3">Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. </verse>
    <verse num="4">We will not hide <i>them</i> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. </verse>
    <verse num="5">For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: </verse>
    <verse num="6">That the generation to come might know <i>them, even</i> the children <i>which</i> should be born; <i>who</i> should arise and declare <i>them</i> to their children: </verse>
    <verse num="7">That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: </verse>
    <verse num="8">And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation <i>that</i> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. </verse>
    <verse num="9">The children of Ephraim, <i>being</i> armed, <i>and</i> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. </verse>
    <verse num="10">They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; </verse>
    <verse num="11">And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <i>in</i> the field of Zoan. </verse>
    <verse num="13">He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. </verse>
    <verse num="14">In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. </verse>
    <verse num="15">He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <i>them</i> drink as <i>out of</i> the great depths. </verse>
    <verse num="16">He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. </verse>
    <verse num="17">And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. </verse>
    <verse num="18">And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? </verse>
    <verse num="20">Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? </verse>
    <verse num="21">Therefore the LORD heard <i>this,</i> and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; </verse>
    <verse num="22">Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: </verse>
    <verse num="23">Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, </verse>
    <verse num="24">And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. </verse>
    <verse num="25">Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full. </verse>
    <verse num="26">He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. </verse>
    <verse num="27">He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: </verse>
    <verse num="28">And he let <i>it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. </verse>
    <verse num="29">So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; </verse>
    <verse num="30">They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <i>was</i> yet in their mouths, </verse>
    <verse num="31">The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <i>men</i> of Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="32">For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. </verse>
    <verse num="33">Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. </verse>
    <verse num="34">When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. </verse>
    <verse num="35">And they remembered that God <i>was</i> their rock, and the high God their redeemer. </verse>
    <verse num="36">Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. </verse>
    <verse num="37">For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. </verse>
    <verse num="38">But he, <i>being</i> full of compassion, forgave <i>their</i> iniquity, and destroyed <i>them</i> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. </verse>
    <verse num="39">For he remembered that they <i>were but</i> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. </verse>
    <verse num="40">How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <i>and</i> grieve him in the desert! </verse>
    <verse num="41">Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="42">They remembered not his hand, <i>nor</i> the day when he delivered them from the enemy. </verse>
    <verse num="43">How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: </verse>
    <verse num="44">And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. </verse>
    <verse num="45">He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. </verse>
    <verse num="46">He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. </verse>
    <verse num="47">He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. </verse>
    <verse num="48">He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. </verse>
    <verse num="49">He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <i>among them.</i> </verse>
    <verse num="50">He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; </verse>
    <verse num="51">And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <i>their</i> strength in the tabernacles of Ham: </verse>
    <verse num="52">But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </verse>
    <verse num="53">And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </verse>
    <verse num="54">And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <i>even to</i> this mountain, <i>which</i> his right hand had purchased. </verse>
    <verse num="55">He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. </verse>
    <verse num="56">Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: </verse>
    <verse num="57">But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. </verse>
    <verse num="58">For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </verse>
    <verse num="59">When God heard <i>this,</i> he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: </verse>
    <verse num="60">So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <i>which</i> he placed among men; </verse>
    <verse num="61">And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand. </verse>
    <verse num="62">He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. </verse>
    <verse num="63">The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. </verse>
    <verse num="64">Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. </verse>
    <verse num="65">Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <i>and</i> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. </verse>
    <verse num="66">And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. </verse>
    <verse num="67">Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: </verse>
    <verse num="68">But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. </verse>
    <verse num="69">And he built his sanctuary like high <i>palaces,</i> like the earth which he hath established for ever. </verse>
    <verse num="70">He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: </verse>
    <verse num="71">From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. </verse>
    <verse num="72">So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.    <H2>Psalm 79</H2>  A Psalm of Asaph.   </verse>
