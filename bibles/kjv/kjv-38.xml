  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and <i>from</i> your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Your fathers, where <i>are</i> they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</verse>
    <verse num="6">But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which <i>is</i> the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="8">I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that <i>were</i> in the bottom; and behind him <i>were there</i> red horses, speckled, and white.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then said I, O my lord, what <i>are</i> these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these <i>be. </i></verse>
    <verse num="10">And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These <i>are they</i> whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me <i>with</i> good words <i>and</i> comfortable words.</verse>
    <verse num="14">So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And I am very sore displeased with the heathen <i>that are</i> at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What <i>be</i> these? And he answered me, These <i>are</i> the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These <i>are</i> the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up <i>their</i> horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what <i>is</i> the breadth thereof, and what <i>is</i> the length thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</verse>
    <verse num="4">And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited <i>as</i> towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:</verse>
    <verse num="5">For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Ho, ho, <i>come forth,</i> and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest <i>with</i> the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: <i>is</i> not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
    <verse num="3">Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="7">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they <i>are</i> men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone <i>shall be</i> seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
    <verse num="10">In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,</verse>
    <verse num="2">And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all <i>of</i> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which <i>are</i> upon the top thereof:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And two olive trees by it, one upon the right <i>side</i> of the bowl, and the other upon the left <i>side</i> thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What <i>are</i> these, my lord?</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This <i>is</i> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Who <i>art</i> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel <i>thou shalt become</i> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone <i>thereof with</i> shoutings, <i>crying,</i> Grace, grace unto it.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel <i>with</i> those seven; they <i>are</i> the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then answered I, and said unto him, What <i>are</i> these two olive trees upon the right <i>side</i> of the candlestick and upon the left <i>side</i> thereof?</verse>
    <verse num="12">And I answered again, and said unto him, What <i>be these</i> two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden <i>oil</i> out of themselves?</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these <i>be?</i> And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then said he, These <i>are</i> the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof <i>is</i> twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then said he unto me, This <i>is</i> the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off <i>as</i> on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off <i>as</i> on that side according to it.</verse>
    <verse num="4">I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what <i>is</i> this that goeth forth.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And I said, What <i>is</i> it? And he said, This <i>is</i> an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This <i>is</i> their resemblance through all the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this <i>is</i> a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he said, This <i>is</i> wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind <i>was</i> in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains <i>were</i> mountains of brass.</verse>
    <verse num="2">In the first chariot <i>were</i> red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
    <verse num="3">And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What <i>are</i> these, my lord?</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the angel answered and said unto me, These <i>are</i> the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="6">The black horses which <i>are</i> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="10">Take of <i>them of</i> the captivity, <i>even</i> of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set <i>them</i> upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;</verse>
    <verse num="12">And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name <i>is</i> The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:</verse>
    <verse num="13">Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they <i>that are</i> far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And <i>this</i> shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, <i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth <i>day</i> of the ninth month, <i>even</i> in Chisleu;</verse>
    <verse num="2">When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,</verse>
    <verse num="3"><i>And</i> to speak unto the priests which <i>were</i> in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="5">Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh <i>month,</i> even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, <i>even</i> to me?</verse>
    <verse num="6">And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat <i>for yourselves,</i> and drink <i>for yourselves? </i></verse>
    <verse num="7"><i>Should ye</i> not <i>hear</i> the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when <i>men</i> inhabited the south and the plain?</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:</verse>
    <verse num="10">And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Yea, they made their hearts <i>as</i> an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Therefore it is come to pass, <i>that</i> as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:</verse>
    <verse num="14">But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">Again the word of the LORD of hosts came <i>to me,</i> saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which <i>were</i> in the day <i>that</i> the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither <i>was there any</i> peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But now I <i>will</i> not <i>be</i> unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For the seed <i>shall be</i> prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these <i>things. </i></verse>
    <verse num="13">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, <i>but</i> let your hands be strong.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:</verse>
    <verse num="15">So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.</verse>
    <verse num="16">These <i>are</i> the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:</verse>
    <verse num="17">And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these <i>are things</i> that I hate, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="19">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth <i>month,</i> and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; <i>It shall</i> yet <i>come to pass,</i> that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the inhabitants of one <i>city</i> shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days <i>it shall come to pass,</i> that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard <i>that</i> God <i>is</i> with you.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus <i>shall be</i> the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, <i>shall be</i> toward the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Ashkelon shall see <i>it,</i> and fear; Gaza also <i>shall see it,</i> and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, <i>shall be</i> for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he <i>is</i> just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion <i>shall be</i> from sea <i>even</i> to sea, and from river <i>even</i> to the ends of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="11">As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein <i>is</i> no water.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare <i>that</i> I will render double unto thee;</verse>
    <verse num="13">When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.</verse>
    <verse num="15">The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, <i>and</i> make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, <i>and</i> as the corners of the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they <i>shall be as</i> the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For how great <i>is</i> his goodness, and how great <i>is</i> his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; <i>so</i> the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because <i>there was</i> no shepherd.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they shall be as mighty <i>men,</i> which tread down <i>their enemies</i> in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD <i>is</i> with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I <i>am</i> the LORD their God, and will hear them.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And <i>they of</i> Ephraim shall be like a mighty <i>man,</i> and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see <i>it,</i> and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="8">I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.</verse>
    <verse num="10">I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and <i>place</i> shall not be found for them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.</verse>
    <verse num="3"><i>There is</i> a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;</verse>
    <verse num="5">Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver <i>them. </i></verse>
    <verse num="7">And I will feed the flock of slaughter, <i>even</i> you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And I took my staff, <i>even</i> Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it <i>was</i> the word of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And I said unto them, If ye think good, give <i>me</i> my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty <i>pieces</i> of silver.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty <i>pieces</i> of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then I cut asunder mine other staff, <i>even</i> Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, <i>which</i> shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword <i>shall be</i> upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</verse>

  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah <i>and</i> against Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.</verse>
    <verse num="4">In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem <i>shall be</i> my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.</verse>
    <verse num="6">In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, <i>even</i> in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify <i>themselves</i> against Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="8">In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David <i>shall be</i> as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for <i>his</i> only <i>son,</i> and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for <i>his</i> firstborn.</verse>
    <verse num="11">In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;</verse>
    <verse num="13">The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;</verse>
    <verse num="14">All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.</verse>

  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, <i>that</i> I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:</verse>
    <verse num="5">But he shall say, I <i>am</i> no prophet, I <i>am</i> an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And <i>one</i> shall say unto him, What <i>are</i> these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, <i>Those</i> with which I was wounded <i>in</i> the house of my friends.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man <i>that is</i> my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off <i>and</i> die; but the third shall be left therein.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It <i>is</i> my people: and they shall say, The LORD <i>is</i> my God.</verse>

  <chapter num="14">
    <verse num="1">Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which <i>is</i> before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, <i>and there shall be</i> a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And ye shall flee <i>to</i> the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, <i>and</i> all the saints with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> the light shall not be clear, <i>nor</i> dark:</verse>
    <verse num="7">But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> at evening time it shall be light.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And it shall be in that day, <i>that</i> living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.</verse>
    <verse num="10">All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and <i>from</i> the tower of Hananeel unto the king’s winepresses.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And <i>men</i> shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And it shall be, <i>that</i> whoso will not come up of <i>all</i> the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that <i>have</i> no <i>rain;</i> there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</verse>
    <verse num="19">This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</verse>
    <verse num="20">In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD’S house shall be like the bowls before the altar.</verse>
