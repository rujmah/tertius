  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</verse>
    <verse num="2">God <i>is</i> jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and <i>is</i> furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth <i>wrath</i> for his enemies.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The LORD <i>is</i> slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit <i>the wicked:</i> the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds <i>are</i> the dust of his feet.</verse>
    <verse num="4">He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.</verse>
    <verse num="5">The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The LORD <i>is</i> good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</verse>
    <verse num="9">What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For while <i>they be</i> folden together <i>as</i> thorns, and while they are drunken <i>as</i> drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.</verse>
    <verse num="11">There is <i>one</i> come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Thus saith the LORD: Though <i>they be</i> quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, <i>that</i> no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.</verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make <i>thy</i> loins strong, fortify <i>thy</i> power mightily.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men <i>are</i> in scarlet: the chariots <i>shall be</i> with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</verse>
    <verse num="4">The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.</verse>
    <verse num="6">The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead <i>her</i> as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, <i>shall they cry;</i> but none shall look back.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for <i>there is</i> none end of the store <i>and</i> glory out of all the pleasant furniture.</verse>
    <verse num="10">She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain <i>is</i> in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Where <i>is</i> the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion, <i>even</i> the old lion, walked, <i>and</i> the lionâ€™s whelp, and none made <i>them</i> afraid?</verse>
    <verse num="12">The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</verse>

  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies <i>and</i> robbery; the prey departeth not;</verse>
    <verse num="2">The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and <i>there is</i> a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and <i>there is</i> none end of <i>their</i> corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:</verse>
    <verse num="4">Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?</verse>
    <verse num="8">Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, <i>that had</i> the waters round about it, whose rampart <i>was</i> the sea, <i>and</i> her wall <i>was</i> from the sea?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Ethiopia and Egypt <i>were</i> her strength, and <i>it was</i> infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Yet <i>was</i> she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.</verse>
    <verse num="12">All thy strong holds <i>shall be like</i> fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Behold, thy people in the midst of thee <i>are</i> women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.</verse>
    <verse num="15">There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Thy crowned <i>are</i> as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, <i>but</i> when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they <i>are. </i></verse>
    <verse num="18">Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell <i>in the dust:</i> thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth <i>them. </i></verse>
