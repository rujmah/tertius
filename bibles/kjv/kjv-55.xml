  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
    <verse num="2">To Timothy, <i>my</i> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I thank God, whom I serve from <i>my</i> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</verse>
    <verse num="4">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</verse>
    <verse num="5">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</verse>
    <verse num="9">Who hath saved us, and called <i>us</i> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</verse>
    <verse num="10">But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</verse>
    <verse num="11">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="14">That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</verse>
    <verse num="15">This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
    <verse num="16">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</verse>
    <verse num="17">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <i>me. </i></verse>
    <verse num="18">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="4">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <i>this</i> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And if a man also strive for masteries, <i>yet</i> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</verse>
    <verse num="6">The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</verse>
    <verse num="9">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <i>even</i> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
    <verse num="11"><i>It is</i> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <i>him,</i> we shall also live with <i>him: </i></verse>
    <verse num="12">If we suffer, we shall also reign with <i>him:</i> if we deny <i>him,</i> he also will deny us:</verse>
    <verse num="13">If we believe not, <i>yet</i> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Of these things put <i>them</i> in remembrance, charging <i>them</i> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, <i>but</i> to the subverting of the hearers.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</verse>
    <verse num="16">But shun profane <i>and</i> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</verse>
    <verse num="18">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</verse>
    <verse num="20">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</verse>
    <verse num="21">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, <i>and</i> prepared unto every good work.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
    <verse num="23">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <i>men,</i> apt to teach, patient,</verse>
    <verse num="25">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</verse>
    <verse num="26">And <i>that</i> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
    <verse num="3">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</verse>
    <verse num="4">Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</verse>
    <verse num="5">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</verse>
    <verse num="7">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <i>men,</i> as theirs also was.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</verse>
    <verse num="11">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of <i>them</i> all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</verse>
    <verse num="13">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned <i>them; </i></verse>
    <verse num="15">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="16">All scripture <i>is</i> given by inspiration of God, and <i>is</i> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</verse>
    <verse num="17">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">I charge <i>thee</i> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</verse>
    <verse num="2">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</verse>
    <verse num="4">And they shall turn away <i>their</i> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
    <verse num="7">I have fought a good fight, I have finished <i>my</i> course, I have kept the faith:</verse>
    <verse num="8">Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</verse>
    <verse num="10">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</verse>
    <verse num="13">The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring <i>with thee,</i> and the books, <i>but</i> especially the parchments.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</verse>
    <verse num="15">Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</verse>
    <verse num="16">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <i>men</i> forsook me: <i>I pray God</i> that it may not be laid to their charge.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and <i>that</i> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve <i>me</i> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
