  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</verse>
    <verse num="2">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</verse>
    <verse num="3">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</verse>
    <verse num="4">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</verse>
    <verse num="5">A wise <i>man</i> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</verse>
    <verse num="6">To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of knowledge: <i>but</i> fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
    <verse num="8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
    <verse num="9">For they <i>shall be</i> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</verse>
    <verse num="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</verse>
    <verse num="11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</verse>
    <verse num="12">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</verse>
    <verse num="13">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</verse>
    <verse num="14">Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</verse>
    <verse num="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</verse>
    <verse num="16">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And they lay wait for their <i>own</i> blood; they lurk privily for their <i>own</i> lives.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So <i>are</i> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; <i>which</i> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</verse>
    <verse num="21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <i>saying, </i></verse>
    <verse num="22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
    <verse num="23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</verse>
    <verse num="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</verse>
    <verse num="26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</verse>
    <verse num="27">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</verse>
    <verse num="29">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</verse>
    <verse num="30">They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
    <verse num="32">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</verse>
    <verse num="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</verse>
    <verse num="2">So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <i>and</i> apply thine heart to understanding;</verse>
    <verse num="3">Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <i>and</i> liftest up thy voice for understanding;</verse>
    <verse num="4">If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <i>for</i> hid treasures;</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <i>cometh</i> knowledge and understanding.</verse>
    <verse num="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: <i>he is</i> a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</verse>
    <verse num="8">He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; <i>yea,</i> every good path.</verse>
    <verse num="10">When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</verse>
    <verse num="11">Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</verse>
    <verse num="12">To deliver thee from the way of the evil <i>man,</i> from the man that speaketh froward things;</verse>
    <verse num="13">Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
    <verse num="14">Who rejoice to do evil, <i>and</i> delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</verse>
    <verse num="15">Whose ways <i>are</i> crooked, and <i>they</i> froward in their paths:</verse>
    <verse num="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, <i>even</i> from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words;</verse>
    <verse num="17">Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</verse>
    <verse num="19">None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</verse>
    <verse num="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good <i>men,</i> and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</verse>
    <verse num="2">For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</verse>
    <verse num="4">So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</verse>
    <verse num="6">In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</verse>
    <verse num="8">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</verse>
    <verse num="10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</verse>
    <verse num="11">My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</verse>
    <verse num="12">For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <i>in whom</i> he delighteth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Happy <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> findeth wisdom, and the man <i>that</i> getteth understanding.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For the merchandise of it <i>is</i> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</verse>
    <verse num="15">She <i>is</i> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Length of days <i>is</i> in her right hand; <i>and</i> in her left hand riches and honour.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Her ways <i>are</i> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <i>are</i> peace.</verse>
    <verse num="18">She <i>is</i> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <i>is every one</i> that retaineth her.</verse>
    <verse num="19">The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</verse>
    <verse num="20">By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>
    <verse num="21">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</verse>
    <verse num="22">So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</verse>
    <verse num="24">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</verse>
    <verse num="26">For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="28">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</verse>
    <verse num="32">For the froward <i>is</i> abomination to the LORD: but his secret <i>is</i> with the righteous.</verse>
    <verse num="33">The curse of the LORD <i>is</i> in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</verse>
    <verse num="35">The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For I was my father’s son, tender and only <i>beloved</i> in the sight of my mother.</verse>
    <verse num="4">He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <i>it</i> not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Wisdom <i>is</i> the principal thing; <i>therefore</i> get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</verse>
    <verse num="9">She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</verse>
    <verse num="11">I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</verse>
    <verse num="12">When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Take fast hold of instruction; let <i>her</i> not go: keep her; for she <i>is</i> thy life.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil <i>men. </i></verse>
    <verse num="15">Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause <i>some</i> to fall.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
    <verse num="18">But the path of the just <i>is</i> as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</verse>
    <verse num="19">The way of the wicked <i>is</i> as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</verse>
    <verse num="20">My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</verse>
    <verse num="22">For they <i>are</i> life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it <i>are</i> the issues of life.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom, <i>and</i> bow thine ear to my understanding:</verse>
    <verse num="2">That thou mayest regard discretion, and <i>that</i> thy lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop <i>as</i> an honeycomb, and her mouth <i>is</i> smoother than oil:</verse>
    <verse num="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, <i>that</i> thou canst not know <i>them. </i></verse>
    <verse num="7">Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</verse>
    <verse num="9">Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</verse>
    <verse num="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours <i>be</i> in the house of a stranger;</verse>
    <verse num="11">And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</verse>
    <verse num="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</verse>
    <verse num="13">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</verse>
    <verse num="14">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, <i>and</i> rivers of waters in the streets.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</verse>
    <verse num="19"><i>Let her be as</i> the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>
    <verse num="21">For the ways of man <i>are</i> before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</verse>
    <verse num="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</verse>
    <verse num="23">He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, <i>if</i> thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand <i>of the hunter,</i> and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</verse>
    <verse num="7">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</verse>
    <verse num="8">Provideth her meat in the summer, <i>and</i> gathereth her food in the harvest.</verse>
    <verse num="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</verse>
    <verse num="10"><i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
    <verse num="11">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</verse>
    <verse num="12">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</verse>
    <verse num="14">Frowardness <i>is</i> in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</verse>
    <verse num="16">These six <i>things</i> doth the LORD hate: yea, seven <i>are</i> an abomination unto him:</verse>
    <verse num="17">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</verse>
    <verse num="18">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</verse>
    <verse num="19">A false witness <i>that</i> speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="20">My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
    <verse num="21">Bind them continually upon thine heart, <i>and</i> tie them about thy neck.</verse>
    <verse num="22">When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and <i>when</i> thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="23">For the commandment <i>is</i> a lamp; and the law <i>is</i> light; and reproofs of instruction <i>are</i> the way of life:</verse>
    <verse num="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</verse>
    <verse num="26">For by means of a whorish woman <i>a man is brought</i> to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</verse>
    <verse num="28">Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</verse>
    <verse num="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</verse>
    <verse num="30"><i>Men</i> do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</verse>
    <verse num="31">But <i>if</i> he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</verse>
    <verse num="32"><i>But</i> whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he <i>that</i> doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</verse>
    <verse num="33">A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</verse>
    <verse num="34">For jealousy <i>is</i> the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</verse>
    <verse num="35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou <i>art</i> my sister; and call understanding <i>thy</i> kinswoman:</verse>
    <verse num="5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</verse>
    <verse num="7">And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</verse>
    <verse num="8">Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</verse>
    <verse num="9">In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</verse>
    <verse num="10">And, behold, there met him a woman <i>with</i> the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</verse>
    <verse num="11">(She <i>is</i> loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now <i>is she</i> without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</verse>
    <verse num="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, <i>and</i> with an impudent face said unto him,</verse>
    <verse num="14"><i>I have</i> peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</verse>
    <verse num="16">I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved <i>works,</i> with fine linen of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</verse>
    <verse num="19">For the goodman <i>is</i> not at home, he is gone a long journey:</verse>
    <verse num="20">He hath taken a bag of money with him, <i>and</i> will come home at the day appointed.</verse>
    <verse num="21">With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</verse>
    <verse num="22">He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</verse>
    <verse num="23">Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it <i>is</i> for his life.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</verse>
    <verse num="26">For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong <i>men</i> have been slain by her.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Her house <i>is</i> the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</verse>
    <verse num="2">She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</verse>
    <verse num="3">She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <i>is</i> to the sons of man.</verse>
    <verse num="5">O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips <i>shall be</i> right things.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <i>is</i> an abomination to my lips.</verse>
    <verse num="8">All the words of my mouth <i>are</i> in righteousness; <i>there is</i> nothing froward or perverse in them.</verse>
    <verse num="9">They <i>are</i> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For wisdom <i>is</i> better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</verse>
    <verse num="12">I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</verse>
    <verse num="13">The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Counsel <i>is</i> mine, and sound wisdom: I <i>am</i> understanding; I have strength.</verse>
    <verse num="15">By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</verse>
    <verse num="16">By me princes rule, and nobles, <i>even</i> all the judges of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="17">I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Riches and honour <i>are</i> with me; <i>yea,</i> durable riches and righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="19">My fruit <i>is</i> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</verse>
    <verse num="20">I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</verse>
    <verse num="21">That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</verse>
    <verse num="22">The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</verse>
    <verse num="23">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</verse>
    <verse num="24">When <i>there were</i> no depths, I was brought forth; when <i>there were</i> no fountains abounding with water.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</verse>
    <verse num="26">While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</verse>
    <verse num="27">When he prepared the heavens, I <i>was</i> there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</verse>
    <verse num="28">When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</verse>
    <verse num="29">When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then I was by him, <i>as</i> one brought up <i>with him:</i> and I was daily <i>his</i> delight, rejoicing always before him;</verse>
    <verse num="31">Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights <i>were</i> with the sons of men.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed <i>are they that</i> keep my ways.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Blessed <i>is</i> the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</verse>
