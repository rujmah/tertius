<book num="Titus">
  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</verse>
    <verse num="2">In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</verse>
    <verse num="3">But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</verse>
    <verse num="4">To Titus, <i>mine</i> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</verse>
    <verse num="6">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</verse>
    <verse num="8">But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</verse>
    <verse num="9">Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</verse>
    <verse num="11">Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</verse>
    <verse num="12">One of themselves, <i>even</i> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <i>are</i> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</verse>
    <verse num="13">This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
    <verse num="14">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Unto the pure all things <i>are</i> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <i>is</i> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</verse>
    <verse num="16">They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <i>him,</i> being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</verse>
    <verse num="2">That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The aged women likewise, that <i>they be</i> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</verse>
    <verse num="4">That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
    <verse num="5"><i>To be</i> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</verse>
    <verse num="7">In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine <i>shewing</i> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</verse>
    <verse num="8">Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</verse>
    <verse num="9"><i>Exhort</i> servants to be obedient unto their own masters, <i>and</i> to please <i>them</i> well in all <i>things;</i> not answering again;</verse>
    <verse num="10">Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</verse>
    <verse num="12">Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</verse>
    <verse num="13">Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
    <verse num="14">Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</verse>
    <verse num="15">These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</verse>
    <verse num="2">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <i>but</i> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <i>and</i> hating one another.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</verse>
    <verse num="5">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</verse>
    <verse num="6">Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
    <verse num="7">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
    <verse num="8"><i>This is</i> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
    <verse num="10">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</verse>
    <verse num="11">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</verse>
    <verse num="12">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</verse>
