<book num="Job">
  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was</i> Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="3">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And his sons went and feasted <i>in their</i> houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And it was so, when the days of <i>their</i> feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings <i>according</i> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</verse>
    <verse num="10">Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath <i>is</i> in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:</verse>
    <verse num="14">And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the Sabeans fell <i>upon them,</i> and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
    <verse num="16">While he <i>was</i> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
    <verse num="17">While he <i>was</i> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
    <verse num="18">While he <i>was</i> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:</verse>
    <verse num="19">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</verse>
    <verse num="21">And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="22">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he <i>is</i> in thine hand; but save his life.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that <i>his</i> grief was very great.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Job spake, and said,</verse>
    <verse num="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night <i>in which</i> it was said, There is a man child conceived.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
    <verse num="6">As <i>for</i> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but <i>have</i> none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</verse>
    <verse num="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my <i>mother’s</i> womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Why died I not from the womb? <i>why</i> did I <i>not</i> give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</verse>
    <verse num="12">Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</verse>
    <verse num="13">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</verse>
    <verse num="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</verse>
    <verse num="15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
    <verse num="16">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants <i>which</i> never saw light.</verse>
    <verse num="17">There the wicked cease <i>from</i> troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</verse>
    <verse num="18"><i>There</i> the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
    <verse num="19">The small and great are there; and the servant <i>is</i> free from his master.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter <i>in</i> soul;</verse>
    <verse num="21">Which long for death, but it <i>cometh</i> not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
    <verse num="22">Which rejoice exceedingly, <i>and</i> are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
    <verse num="23"><i>Why is light given</i> to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
    <verse num="24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
    <verse num="25">For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="26">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
    <verse num="2"><i>If</i> we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
    <verse num="3">Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
    <verse num="6"><i>Is</i> not <i>this</i> thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</verse>
    <verse num="7">Remember, I pray thee, who <i>ever</i> perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</verse>
    <verse num="8">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</verse>
    <verse num="9">By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</verse>
    <verse num="10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="13">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</verse>
    <verse num="14">Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</verse>
    <verse num="16">It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image <i>was</i> before mine eyes, <i>there was</i> silence, and I heard a voice, <i>saying, </i></verse>
    <verse num="17">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
    <verse num="18">Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</verse>
    <verse num="19">How much less <i>in</i> them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation <i>is</i> in the dust, <i>which</i> are crushed before the moth?</verse>
    <verse num="20">They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="21">Doth not their excellency <i>which is</i> in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</verse>
    <verse num="2">For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
    <verse num="4">His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither <i>is there</i> any to deliver <i>them. </i></verse>
    <verse num="5">Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
    <verse num="7">Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
    <verse num="8">I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</verse>
    <verse num="9">Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</verse>
    <verse num="10">Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</verse>
    <verse num="11">To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</verse>
    <verse num="12">He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform <i>their</i> enterprise.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</verse>
    <verse num="14">They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
    <verse num="16">So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Behold, happy <i>is</i> the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</verse>
    <verse num="18">For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</verse>
    <verse num="19">He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
    <verse num="20">In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</verse>
    <verse num="22">At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="23">For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle <i>shall be</i> in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Thou shalt know also that thy seed <i>shall be</i> great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Thou shalt come to <i>thy</i> grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Lo this, we have searched it, so it <i>is;</i> hear it, and know thou <i>it</i> for thy good.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">But Job answered and said,</verse>
    <verse num="2">O that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</verse>
    <verse num="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For the arrows of the Almighty <i>are</i> within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</verse>
    <verse num="6">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there <i>any</i> taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
    <verse num="7">The things <i>that</i> my soul refused to touch <i>are</i> as my sorrowful meat.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant <i>me</i> the thing that I long for!</verse>
    <verse num="9">Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</verse>
    <verse num="11">What <i>is</i> my strength, that I should hope? and what <i>is</i> mine end, that I should prolong my life?</verse>
    <verse num="12"><i>Is</i> my strength the strength of stones? or <i>is</i> my flesh of brass?</verse>
    <verse num="13"><i>Is</i> not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</verse>
    <verse num="14">To him that is afflicted pity <i>should be shewed</i> from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
    <verse num="15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, <i>and</i> as the stream of brooks they pass away;</verse>
    <verse num="16">Which are blackish by reason of the ice, <i>and</i> wherein the snow is hid:</verse>
    <verse num="17">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
    <verse num="18">The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</verse>
    <verse num="19">The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
    <verse num="20">They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For now ye are no thing; ye see <i>my</i> casting down, and are afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</verse>
    <verse num="23">Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</verse>
    <verse num="24">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
    <verse num="25">How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</verse>
    <verse num="26">Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, <i>which are</i> as wind?</verse>
    <verse num="27">Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig <i>a pit</i> for your friend.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Now therefore be content, look upon me; for <i>it is</i> evident unto you if I lie.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness <i>is</i> in it.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1"><i>Is there</i> not an appointed time to man upon earth? <i>are not</i> his days also like the days of an hireling?</verse>
    <verse num="2">As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for <i>the reward of</i> his work:</verse>
    <verse num="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
    <verse num="4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</verse>
    <verse num="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</verse>
    <verse num="6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>
    <verse num="7">O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no <i>more:</i> thine eyes <i>are</i> upon me, and I <i>am</i> not.</verse>
    <verse num="9"><i>As</i> the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no <i>more. </i></verse>
    <verse num="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
    <verse num="12"><i>Am</i> I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</verse>
    <verse num="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</verse>
    <verse num="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, <i>and</i> death rather than my life.</verse>
    <verse num="16">I loathe <i>it;</i> I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days <i>are</i> vanity.</verse>
    <verse num="17">What <i>is</i> man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</verse>
    <verse num="18">And <i>that</i> thou shouldest visit him every morning, <i>and</i> try him every moment?</verse>
    <verse num="19">How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</verse>
    <verse num="20">I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</verse>
    <verse num="21">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I <i>shall</i> not <i>be.</i></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</verse>
    <verse num="2">How long wilt thou speak these <i>things?</i> and <i>how long shall</i> the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</verse>
    <verse num="3">Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</verse>
    <verse num="4">If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</verse>
    <verse num="5">If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</verse>
    <verse num="6">If thou <i>wert</i> pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</verse>
    <verse num="9">(For we <i>are but of</i> yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth <i>are</i> a shadow:)</verse>
    <verse num="10">Shall not they teach thee, <i>and</i> tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</verse>
    <verse num="11">Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</verse>
    <verse num="12">Whilst it <i>is</i> yet in his greenness, <i>and</i> not cut down, it withereth before any <i>other</i> herb.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So <i>are</i> the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:</verse>
    <verse num="14">Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust <i>shall be</i> a spider’s web.</verse>
    <verse num="15">He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</verse>
    <verse num="16">He <i>is</i> green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</verse>
    <verse num="17">His roots are wrapped about the heap, <i>and</i> seeth the place of stones.</verse>
    <verse num="18">If he destroy him from his place, then <i>it</i> shall deny him, <i>saying,</i> I have not seen thee.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Behold, this <i>is</i> the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect <i>man,</i> neither will he help the evil doers:</verse>
    <verse num="21">Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</verse>
    <verse num="22">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
    <verse num="2">I know <i>it is</i> so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</verse>
    <verse num="3">If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</verse>
    <verse num="4"><i>He is</i> wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened <i>himself</i> against him, and hath prospered?</verse>
    <verse num="5">Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see <i>him</i> not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</verse>
    <verse num="13"><i>If</i> God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">How much less shall I answer him, <i>and</i> choose out my words <i>to reason</i> with him?</verse>
    <verse num="15">Whom, though I were righteous, <i>yet</i> would I not answer, <i>but</i> I would make supplication to my judge.</verse>
    <verse num="16">If I had called, and he had answered me; <i>yet</i> would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</verse>
    <verse num="18">He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</verse>
    <verse num="19">If <i>I speak</i> of strength, lo, <i>he is</i> strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time <i>to plead? </i></verse>
    <verse num="20">If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: <i>if I say, I am</i> perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</verse>
    <verse num="21"><i>Though</i> I <i>were</i> perfect, <i>yet</i> would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</verse>
    <verse num="22">This <i>is</i> one <i>thing,</i> therefore I said <i>it,</i> He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</verse>
    <verse num="23">If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</verse>
    <verse num="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, <i>and</i> who <i>is</i> he?</verse>
    <verse num="25">Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</verse>
    <verse num="26">They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle <i>that</i> hasteth to the prey.</verse>
    <verse num="27">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort <i>myself: </i></verse>
    <verse num="28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</verse>

    <verse num="8">He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown <i>from</i> my head.</verse>
    <verse num="10">He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</verse>
    <verse num="11">He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as <i>one of</i> his enemies.</verse>
    <verse num="12">His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</verse>

    <verse num="21">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</verse>
    <verse num="23">Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</verse>
    <verse num="24">That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</verse>
    <verse num="25">For I know <i>that</i> my redeemer liveth, and <i>that</i> he shall stand at the latter <i>day</i> upon the earth:</verse>
    <verse num="26">And <i>though</i> after my skin <i>worms</i> destroy this <i>body,</i> yet in my flesh shall I see God:</verse>
    <verse num="27">Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; <i>though</i> my reins be consumed within me.</verse>
    <verse num="28">But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</verse>

    <verse num="22">Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</verse>
    <verse num="23">God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="24">For he looketh to the ends of the earth, <i>and</i> seeth under the whole heaven;</verse>
    <verse num="25">To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.</verse>
    <verse num="26">When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that <i>is</i> wisdom; and to depart from evil <i>is</i> understanding.</verse>

  <chapter num="29">
    <verse num="1">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Oh that I were as <i>in</i> months past, as <i>in</i> the days <i>when</i> God preserved me;</verse>
    <verse num="3">When his candle shined upon my head, <i>and when</i> by his light I walked <i>through</i> darkness;</verse>
    <verse num="4">As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God <i>was</i> upon my tabernacle;</verse>
    <verse num="5">When the Almighty <i>was</i> yet with me, <i>when</i> my children <i>were</i> about me;</verse>
    <verse num="6">When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</verse>
    <verse num="7">When I went out to the gate through the city, <i>when</i> I prepared my seat in the street!</verse>
    <verse num="8">The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, <i>and</i> stood up.</verse>
    <verse num="9">The princes refrained talking, and laid <i>their</i> hand on their mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="10">The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="11">When the ear heard <i>me,</i> then it blessed me; and when the eye saw <i>me,</i> it gave witness to me:</verse>
    <verse num="12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and <i>him that had</i> none to help him.</verse>
    <verse num="13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</verse>
    <verse num="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment <i>was</i> as a robe and a diadem.</verse>
    <verse num="15">I was eyes to the blind, and feet <i>was</i> I to the lame.</verse>
    <verse num="16">I <i>was</i> a father to the poor: and the cause <i>which</i> I knew not I searched out.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply <i>my</i> days as the sand.</verse>
    <verse num="19">My root <i>was</i> spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</verse>
    <verse num="20">My glory <i>was</i> fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Unto me <i>men</i> gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</verse>
    <verse num="22">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide <i>as</i> for the latter rain.</verse>
    <verse num="24"><i>If</i> I laughed on them, they believed <i>it</i> not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</verse>
    <verse num="25">I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one <i>that</i> comforteth the mourners.</verse>

  <chapter num="30">
    <verse num="1">But now <i>they that are</i> younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Yea, whereto <i>might</i> the strength of their hands <i>profit</i> me, in whom old age was perished?</verse>
    <verse num="3">For want and famine <i>they were</i> solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots <i>for</i> their meat.</verse>
    <verse num="5">They were driven forth from among <i>men,</i> (they cried after them as <i>after</i> a thief;)</verse>
    <verse num="6">To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, <i>in</i> caves of the earth, and <i>in</i> the rocks.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</verse>
    <verse num="8"><i>They were</i> children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</verse>
    <verse num="10">They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Upon <i>my</i> right <i>hand</i> rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</verse>
    <verse num="13">They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</verse>
    <verse num="14">They came <i>upon me</i> as a wide breaking in <i>of waters:</i> in the desolation they rolled themselves <i>upon me. </i></verse>
    <verse num="15">Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</verse>
    <verse num="17">My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</verse>
    <verse num="18">By the great force <i>of my disease</i> is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</verse>
    <verse num="19">He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</verse>
    <verse num="20">I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me <i>not. </i></verse>
    <verse num="21">Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride <i>upon it,</i> and dissolvest my substance.</verse>
    <verse num="23">For I know <i>that</i> thou wilt bring me <i>to</i> death, and <i>to</i> the house appointed for all living.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Howbeit he will not stretch out <i>his</i> hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was <i>not</i> my soul grieved for the poor?</verse>
    <verse num="26">When I looked for good, then evil came <i>unto me:</i> and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</verse>
    <verse num="27">My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</verse>
    <verse num="28">I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, <i>and</i> I cried in the congregation.</verse>
    <verse num="29">I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</verse>
    <verse num="30">My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</verse>
    <verse num="31">My harp also is <i>turned</i> to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</verse>

  <chapter num="31">
    <verse num="1">I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?</verse>

    <verse num="29">If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</verse>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="32">
    <verse num="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he <i>was</i> righteous in his own eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</verse>
    <verse num="5">When Elihu saw that <i>there was</i> no answer in the mouth of <i>these</i> three men, then his wrath was kindled.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I <i>am</i> young, and ye <i>are</i> very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</verse>
    <verse num="7">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But <i>there is</i> a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Great men are not <i>always</i> wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, <i>there was</i> none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</verse>
    <verse num="13">Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Now he hath not directed <i>his</i> words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</verse>
    <verse num="15">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</verse>
    <verse num="16">When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, <i>and</i> answered no more;)</verse>
    <verse num="17"><i>I said,</i> I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Behold, my belly <i>is</i> as wine <i>which</i> hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</verse>
    <verse num="20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</verse>
    <verse num="22">For I know not to give flattering titles; <i>in so doing</i> my maker would soon take me away.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="33">
    <verse num="1">Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="3">My words <i>shall be of</i> the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</verse>
    <verse num="4">The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</verse>
    <verse num="5">If thou canst answer me, set <i>thy words</i> in order before me, stand up.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Behold, I <i>am</i> according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of <i>thy</i> words, <i>saying, </i></verse>
    <verse num="9">I am clean without transgression, I <i>am</i> innocent; neither <i>is there</i> iniquity in me.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</verse>
    <verse num="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Behold, <i>in</i> this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For God speaketh once, yea twice, <i>yet man</i> perceiveth it not.</verse>
    <verse num="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</verse>
    <verse num="17">That he may withdraw man <i>from his</i> purpose, and hide pride from man.</verse>
    <verse num="18">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong <i>pain: </i></verse>
    <verse num="20">So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</verse>
    <verse num="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones <i>that</i> were not seen stick out.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</verse>
    <verse num="23">If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</verse>
    <verse num="25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:</verse>
    <verse num="26">He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="27">He looketh upon men, and <i>if any</i> say, I have sinned, and perverted <i>that which was</i> right, and it profited me not;</verse>
    <verse num="28">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Lo, all these <i>things</i> worketh God oftentimes with man,</verse>
    <verse num="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</verse>
    <verse num="32">If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</verse>
    <verse num="33">If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="34">
    <verse num="1">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Hear my words, O ye wise <i>men;</i> and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what <i>is</i> good.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Should I lie against my right? my wound <i>is</i> incurable without transgression.</verse>
    <verse num="7">What man <i>is</i> like Job, <i>who</i> drinketh up scorning like water?</verse>
    <verse num="8">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, <i>that he should do</i> wickedness; and <i>from</i> the Almighty, <i>that he should commit</i> iniquity.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to <i>his</i> ways.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</verse>
    <verse num="14">If he set his heart upon man, <i>if</i> he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</verse>
    <verse num="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</verse>
    <verse num="16">If now <i>thou hast</i> understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</verse>
    <verse num="18"><i>Is it fit</i> to say to a king, <i>Thou art</i> wicked? <i>and</i> to princes, <i>Ye are</i> ungodly?</verse>
    <verse num="19"><i>How much less to him</i> that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all <i>are</i> the work of his hands.</verse>
    <verse num="20">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For his eyes <i>are</i> upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</verse>
    <verse num="22"><i>There is</i> no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="23">For he will not lay upon man more <i>than right;</i> that he should enter into judgment with God.</verse>
    <verse num="24">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth <i>them</i> in the night, so that they are destroyed.</verse>
    <verse num="26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</verse>
    <verse num="27">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</verse>
    <verse num="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</verse>
    <verse num="29">When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth <i>his</i> face, who then can behold him? whether <i>it be done</i> against a nation, or against a man only:</verse>
    <verse num="30">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne <i>chastisement,</i> I will not offend <i>any more: </i></verse>
    <verse num="32"><i>That which</i> I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</verse>
    <verse num="33"><i>Should it be</i> according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words <i>were</i> without wisdom.</verse>
    <verse num="36">My desire <i>is that</i> Job may be tried unto the end because of <i>his</i> answers for wicked men.</verse>
    <verse num="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth <i>his hands</i> among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="35">
    <verse num="1">Elihu spake moreover, and said,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thinkest thou this to be right, <i>that</i> thou saidst, My righteousness <i>is</i> more than God’s?</verse>
    <verse num="3">For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? <i>and,</i> What profit shall I have, <i>if I be cleansed</i> from my sin?</verse>
    <verse num="4">I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds <i>which</i> are higher than thou.</verse>
    <verse num="6">If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or <i>if</i> thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</verse>
    <verse num="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</verse>
    <verse num="8">Thy wickedness <i>may hurt</i> a man as thou <i>art;</i> and thy righteousness <i>may profit</i> the son of man.</verse>
    <verse num="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make <i>the oppressed</i> to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But none saith, Where <i>is</i> God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</verse>
    <verse num="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</verse>
    <verse num="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, <i>yet</i> judgment <i>is</i> before him; therefore trust thou in him.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But now, because <i>it is</i> not <i>so,</i> he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth <i>it</i> not in great extremity:</verse>
    <verse num="16">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="36">
    <verse num="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that <i>I have</i> yet to speak on God’s behalf.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For truly my words <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> false: he that is perfect in knowledge <i>is</i> with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Behold, God <i>is</i> mighty, and despiseth not <i>any: he is</i> mighty in strength <i>and</i> wisdom.</verse>
    <verse num="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</verse>
    <verse num="7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings <i>are they</i> on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And if <i>they be</i> bound in fetters, <i>and</i> be holden in cords of affliction;</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</verse>
    <verse num="10">He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</verse>
    <verse num="11">If they obey and serve <i>him,</i> they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</verse>
    <verse num="12">But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</verse>
    <verse num="13">But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">They die in youth, and their life <i>is</i> among the unclean.</verse>
    <verse num="15">He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait <i>into</i> a broad place, where <i>there is</i> no straitness; and that which <i>should be</i> set on thy table should be full of fatness.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold <i>on thee. </i></verse>

    <verse num="20">Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</verse>

    <verse num="25">Every man may see it; man may behold <i>it</i> afar off.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Behold, God <i>is</i> great, and we know <i>him</i> not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</verse>
    <verse num="27">For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</verse>
    <verse num="28">Which the clouds do drop <i>and</i> distil upon man abundantly.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Also can <i>any</i> understand the spreadings of the clouds, <i>or</i> the noise of his tabernacle?</verse>
    <verse num="30">Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="31">For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</verse>

    <verse num="5">God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</verse>

    <verse num="14">Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</verse>

    <verse num="17">How thy garments <i>are</i> warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south <i>wind? </i></verse>
    <verse num="18">Hast thou with him spread out the sky, <i>which is</i> strong, <i>and</i> as a molten looking glass?</verse>
    <verse num="19">Teach us what we shall say unto him; <i>for</i> we cannot order <i>our speech</i> by reason of darkness.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And now <i>men</i> see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</verse>
    <verse num="23"><i>Touching</i> the Almighty, we cannot find him out: <i>he is</i> excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</verse>

    <verse num="4">Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="5">I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Wherefore I abhor <i>myself,</i> and repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And it was <i>so,</i> that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing that is</i> right, as my servant Job <i>hath. </i></verse>
    <verse num="8">Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you <i>after your</i> folly, in that ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing which is</i> right, like my servant Job.</verse>
    <verse num="9">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite <i>and</i> Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And in all the land were no women found <i>so</i> fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="16">After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, <i>even</i> four generations.</verse>
