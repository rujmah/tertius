    <verse num="1">The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</verse>
    <verse num="4">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</verse>
    <verse num="6">Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</verse>
    <verse num="7">Because that for his nameâ€™s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
    <verse num="8">We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</verse>
    <verse num="9">I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth <i>them</i> out of the church.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Demetrius hath good report of all <i>men,</i> and of the truth itself: yea, and we <i>also</i> bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</verse>
