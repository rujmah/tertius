  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
    <verse num="3">All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</verse>
    <verse num="4">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</verse>
    <verse num="6">There was a man sent from God, whose name <i>was</i> John.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all <i>men</i> through him might believe.</verse>
    <verse num="8">He was not that Light, but <i>was sent</i> to bear witness of that Light.</verse>
    <verse num="9"><i>That</i> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</verse>
    <verse num="10">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
    <verse num="11">He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
    <verse num="12">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, <i>even</i> to them that believe on his name:</verse>
    <verse num="13">Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</verse>
    <verse num="15">John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For the law was given by Moses, <i>but</i> grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="18">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared <i>him.</i></verse>
    <verse num="19">And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
    <verse num="23">He said, I <i>am</i> the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</verse>
    <verse num="26">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</verse>
    <verse num="27">He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
    <verse num="28">These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
    <verse num="29">The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</verse>
    <verse num="30">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</verse>
    <verse num="36">And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</verse>
    <verse num="37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="38">Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, <span class="j">What seek ye?</span> They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</verse>
    <verse num="39">He saith unto them, <span class="j">Come and see.</span> They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
    <verse num="40">One of the two which heard John <i>speak,</i> and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.</verse>
    <verse num="41">He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="42">And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, <span class="j">Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,</span> which is by interpretation, A stone.</verse>
    <verse num="43">The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, <span class="j">Follow me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="44">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
    <verse num="45">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
    <verse num="46">And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</verse>
    <verse num="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, <span class="j">Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! </span></verse>
    <verse num="48">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="j">Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. </span></verse>
    <verse num="49">Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="50">Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="j">Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. </span></verse>
    <verse num="51">And he saith unto him, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</verse>
    <verse num="2">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="6">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Fill the waterpots with water.</span> And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he saith unto them, <span class="j">Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.</span> And they bare <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="9">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</verse>
    <verse num="10">And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: <i>but</i> thou hast kept the good wine until now.</verse>
    <verse num="11">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
    <verse num="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</verse>
    <verse num="14">And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;</verse>
    <verse num="16">And said unto them that sold doves, <span class="j">Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17">And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</verse>
    <verse num="19">Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20">Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</verse>
    <verse num="21">But he spake of the temple of his body.</verse>
    <verse num="22">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast <i>day,</i> many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</verse>
    <verse num="24">But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all <i>men, </i></verse>
    <verse num="25">And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</verse>
    <verse num="2">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="4">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</verse>
    <verse num="5">Jesus answered, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <i>of</i> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</verse>
    <verse num="10">Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="j">Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you <i>of</i> heavenly things? </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <i>even</i> the Son of man which is in heaven. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. </span></verse>
    <verse num="21"><span class="j">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</verse>
    <verse num="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then there arose a question between <i>some</i> of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all <i>men</i> come to him.</verse>
    <verse num="27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</verse>
    <verse num="29">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
    <verse num="30">He must increase, but I <i>must</i> decrease.</verse>
    <verse num="31">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</verse>
    <verse num="33">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</verse>
    <verse num="34">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure <i>unto him. </i></verse>
    <verse num="35">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="36">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</verse>
    <verse num="2">(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</verse>
    <verse num="3">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he must needs go through Samaria.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <i>his</i> journey, sat thus on the well: <i>and</i> it was about the sixth hour.</verse>
    <verse num="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">Give me to drink. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8">(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="j">If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</verse>
    <verse num="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
    <verse num="13">Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="j">Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">Go, call thy husband, and come hither. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, <span class="j">Thou hast well said, I have no husband: </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22"><span class="j">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. </span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">God <i>is</i> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship <i>him</i> in spirit and in truth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">I that speak unto thee am <i>he.</i> </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="27">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</verse>
    <verse num="28">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</verse>
    <verse num="29">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="31">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</verse>
    <verse num="32">But he said unto them, <span class="j">I have meat to eat that ye know not of. </span></verse>
    <verse num="33">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <i>ought</i> to eat?</verse>
    <verse num="34">Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <i>then</i> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. </span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="39">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
    <verse num="40">So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And many more believed because of his own word;</verse>
    <verse num="42">And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard <i>him</i> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
    <verse num="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</verse>
    <verse num="45">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</verse>
    <verse num="46">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
    <verse num="47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</verse>
    <verse num="48">Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="j">Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. </span></verse>
    <verse num="49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</verse>
    <verse num="50">Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">Go thy way; thy son liveth.</span> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</verse>
    <verse num="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <i>him,</i> saying, Thy son liveth.</verse>
    <verse num="52">Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
    <verse num="53">So the father knew that <i>it was</i> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, <span class="j">Thy son liveth:</span> and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
    <verse num="54">This <i>is</i> again the second miracle <i>that</i> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <i>market</i> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
    <verse num="3">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</verse>
    <verse num="6">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <i>in that case,</i> he saith unto him, <span class="j">Wilt thou be made whole? </span></verse>
    <verse num="7">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</verse>
    <verse num="10">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <i>thy</i> bed.</verse>
    <verse num="11">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, <span class="j">Take up thy bed, and walk. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, <span class="j">Take up thy bed, and walk? </span></verse>
    <verse num="13">And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <i>that</i> place.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, <span class="j">Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But Jesus answered them, <span class="j">My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. </span></verse>
    <verse num="21"><span class="j">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth <i>them;</i> even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22"><span class="j">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: </span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">That all <i>men</i> should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. </span></verse>
    <verse num="33"><span class="j">Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="34"><span class="j">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">But I have greater witness than <i>that</i> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="39"><span class="j">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. </span></verse>
    <verse num="41"><span class="j">I receive not honour from men. </span></verse>

  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is <i>the sea</i> of Tiberias.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</verse>
    <verse num="5">When Jesus then lifted up <i>his</i> eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, <span class="j">Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? </span></verse>
    <verse num="6">And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</verse>
    <verse num="8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,</verse>
    <verse num="9">There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Jesus said, <span class="j">Make the men sit down.</span> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</verse>
    <verse num="12">When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, <span class="j">Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13">Therefore they gathered <i>them</i> together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</verse>
    <verse num="15">When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And when even was <i>now</i> come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</verse>
    <verse num="17">And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="20">But he saith unto them, <span class="j">It is I; be not afraid. </span></verse>
    <verse num="21">Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</verse>
    <verse num="22">The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but <i>that</i> his disciples were gone away alone;</verse>
    <verse num="23">(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</verse>
    <verse num="24">When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</verse>
    <verse num="26">Jesus answered them and said, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28">Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</verse>
    <verse num="29">Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="j">This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30">They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</verse>
    <verse num="31">Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="33"><span class="j">For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. </span></verse>
    <verse num="34">Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. </span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="39"><span class="j">And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. </span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. </span></verse>
    <verse num="41">The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, <span class="j">I am the bread which came down from heaven. </span></verse>
    <verse num="42">And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, <span class="j">I came down from heaven? </span></verse>
    <verse num="43">Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Murmur not among yourselves. </span></verse>
    <verse num="44"><span class="j">No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. </span></verse>
    <verse num="45"><span class="j">It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="46"><span class="j">Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father. </span></verse>
    <verse num="47"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. </span></verse>
    <verse num="48"><span class="j">I am that bread of life. </span></verse>
    <verse num="49"><span class="j">Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. </span></verse>
    <verse num="50"><span class="j">This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. </span></verse>
    <verse num="51"><span class="j">I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. </span></verse>
    <verse num="52">The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us <i>his</i> flesh to eat?</verse>
    <verse num="53">Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="54"><span class="j">Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. </span></verse>
    <verse num="55"><span class="j">For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. </span></verse>
    <verse num="56"><span class="j">He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="57"><span class="j">As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="58"><span class="j">This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. </span></verse>
    <verse num="59">These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</verse>
    <verse num="60">Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard <i>this,</i> said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</verse>
    <verse num="61">When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, <span class="j">Doth this offend you? </span></verse>
    <verse num="62"><span class="j"><i>What</i> and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? </span></verse>
    <verse num="63"><span class="j">It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, <i>they</i> are spirit, and <i>they</i> are life. </span></verse>
    <verse num="64"><span class="j">But there are some of you that believe not.</span> For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.</verse>
    <verse num="65">And he said, <span class="j">Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="66">From that <i>time</i> many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</verse>
    <verse num="67">Then said Jesus unto the twelve, <span class="j">Will ye also go away? </span></verse>
    <verse num="68">Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</verse>
    <verse num="69">And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
    <verse num="70">Jesus answered them, <span class="j">Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? </span></verse>
    <verse num="71">He spake of Judas Iscariot <i>the son</i> of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
    <verse num="3">His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For <i>there is</i> no man <i>that</i> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For neither did his brethren believe in him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9">When he had said these words unto them, he abode <i>still</i> in Galilee.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</verse>
    <verse num="12">And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</verse>
    <verse num="16">Jesus answered them, and said, <span class="j">My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <i>whether</i> I speak of myself. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">Did not Moses give you the law, and <i>yet</i> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? </span></verse>
    <verse num="20">The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</verse>
    <verse num="21">Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="j">I have done one work, and ye all marvel. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22"><span class="j">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. </span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25">Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</verse>
    <verse num="26">But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</verse>
    <verse num="27">Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, <span class="j">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30">Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this <i>man</i> hath done?</verse>
    <verse num="32">The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="j">Yet a little while am I with you, and <i>then</i> I go unto him that sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="34"><span class="j">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me:</i> and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35">Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</verse>
    <verse num="36">What <i>manner of</i> saying is this that he said, <span class="j">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me:</i> and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come? </span></verse>
    <verse num="37">In the last day, that great <i>day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, <span class="j">If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. </span></verse>
    <verse num="39">(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <i>given;</i> because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</verse>
    <verse num="40">Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</verse>
    <verse num="41">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
    <verse num="42">Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</verse>
    <verse num="43">So there was a division among the people because of him.</verse>
    <verse num="44">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</verse>
    <verse num="45">Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</verse>
    <verse num="46">The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</verse>
    <verse num="47">Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</verse>
    <verse num="48">Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</verse>
    <verse num="49">But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</verse>
    <verse num="50">Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</verse>
    <verse num="51">Doth our law judge <i>any</i> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</verse>
    <verse num="52">They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</verse>
    <verse num="53">And every man went unto his own house.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</verse>
    <verse num="4">They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</verse>
    <verse num="6">This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <i>his</i> finger wrote on the ground, <i>as though he heard them not. </i></verse>
    <verse num="7">So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, <span class="j">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8">And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they which heard <i>it,</i> being convicted by <i>their own</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <i>even</i> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
    <verse num="10">When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, <span class="j">Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? </span></verse>
    <verse num="11">She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, <span class="j">Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="12">Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, <span class="j">I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13">The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="j">Though I bear record of myself, <i>yet</i> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19">Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, <span class="j">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20">These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then said Jesus again unto them, <span class="j">I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22">Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, <span class="j">Whither I go, ye cannot come. </span></verse>
    <verse num="23">And he said unto them, <span class="j">Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am <i>he,</i> ye shall die in your sins. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Even <i>the same</i> that I said unto you from the beginning. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27">They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="j">When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <i>he,</i> and <i>that</i> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30">As he spake these words, many believed on him.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, <span class="j">If ye continue in my word, <i>then</i> are ye my disciples indeed; </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="33">They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, <span class="j">Ye shall be made free? </span></verse>
    <verse num="34">Jesus answered them, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <i>but</i> the Son abideth ever. </span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. </span></verse>
    <verse num="39">They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. </span></verse>
    <verse num="40"><span class="j">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. </span></verse>
    <verse num="41"><span class="j">Ye do the deeds of your father.</span> Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <i>even</i> God.</verse>
    <verse num="42">Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="43"><span class="j">Why do ye not understand my speech? <i>even</i> because ye cannot hear my word. </span></verse>
    <verse num="44"><span class="j">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of <i>your</i> father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. </span></verse>
    <verse num="45"><span class="j">And because I tell <i>you</i> the truth, ye believe me not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="46"><span class="j">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? </span></verse>
    <verse num="47"><span class="j">He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear <i>them</i> not, because ye are not of God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="48">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</verse>
    <verse num="49">Jesus answered, <span class="j">I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="50"><span class="j">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="51"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. </span></verse>
    <verse num="52">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, <span class="j">If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. </span></verse>
    <verse num="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</verse>
    <verse num="54">Jesus answered, <span class="j">If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: </span></verse>
    <verse num="55"><span class="j">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. </span></verse>
    <verse num="56"><span class="j">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <i>it,</i> and was glad. </span></verse>
    <verse num="57">Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</verse>
    <verse num="58">Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. </span></verse>
    <verse num="59">Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">And as <i>Jesus</i> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from <i>his</i> birth.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
    <verse num="3">Jesus answered, <span class="j">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. </span></verse>
    <verse num="6">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</verse>
    <verse num="7">And said unto him, <span class="j">Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,</span> (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Some said, This is he: others <i>said,</i> He is like him: <i>but</i> he said, I am <i>he. </i></verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</verse>
    <verse num="11">He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, <span class="j">Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash:</span> and I went and washed, and I received sight.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</verse>
    <verse num="13">They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</verse>
    <verse num="17">They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</verse>
    <verse num="18">But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</verse>
    <verse num="20">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>
    <verse num="21">But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</verse>
    <verse num="22">These <i>words</i> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</verse>
    <verse num="25">He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner <i>or no,</i> I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</verse>
    <verse num="27">He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <i>it</i> again? will ye also be his disciples?</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.</verse>
    <verse num="29">We know that God spake unto Moses: <i>as for</i> this <i>fellow,</i> we know not from whence he is.</verse>
    <verse num="30">The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <i>yet</i> he hath opened mine eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</verse>
    <verse num="33">If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</verse>
    <verse num="34">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, <span class="j">Dost thou believe on the Son of God? </span></verse>
    <verse num="36">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</verse>
    <verse num="37">And Jesus said unto him, <span class="j">Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And Jesus said, <span class="j">For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. </span></verse>
    <verse num="40">And <i>some</i> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</verse>
    <verse num="41">Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. </span></verse>
    <verse num="2"><span class="j">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. </span></verse>
    <verse num="3"><span class="j">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. </span></verse>
    <verse num="6">This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then said Jesus unto them again, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have <i>it</i> more abundantly. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11"><span class="j">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12"><span class="j">But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">I am the good shepherd, and know my <i>sheep,</i> and am known of mine. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, <i>and</i> one shepherd. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="19">There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</verse>
    <verse num="21">Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</verse>
    <verse num="22">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Jesus answered them, <span class="j">I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any <i>man</i> pluck them out of my hand. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29"><span class="j">My Father, which gave <i>them</i> me, is greater than all; and no <i>man</i> is able to pluck <i>them</i> out of my Father’s hand. </span></verse>
    <verse num="30"><span class="j">I and <i>my</i> Father are one. </span></verse>
    <verse num="31">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Jesus answered them, <span class="j">Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? </span></verse>
    <verse num="33">The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Jesus answered them, <span class="j">Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; </span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? </span></verse>
    <verse num="37"><span class="j">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38"><span class="j">But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="39">Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</verse>
    <verse num="40">And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</verse>
    <verse num="42">And many believed on him there.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">Now a certain <i>man</i> was sick, <i>named</i> Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
    <verse num="2">(It was <i>that</i> Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
    <verse num="3">Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
    <verse num="4">When Jesus heard <i>that,</i> he said, <span class="j">This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
    <verse num="6">When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then after that saith he to <i>his</i> disciples, <span class="j">Let us go into Judaea again. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><i>His</i> disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Jesus answered, <span class="j">Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10"><span class="j">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11">These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, <span class="j">Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then said Jesus unto them plainly, <span class="j">Lazarus is dead. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16">Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then when Jesus came, he found that he had <i>lain</i> in the grave four days already.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</verse>
    <verse num="19">And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat <i>still</i> in the house.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give <i>it</i> thee.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">Thy brother shall rise again. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Jesus said unto her, <span class="j">I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? </span></verse>
    <verse num="27">She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</verse>
    <verse num="29">As soon as she heard <i>that,</i> she arose quickly, and came unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</verse>
    <verse num="31">The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
    <verse num="33">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</verse>
    <verse num="34">And said, <span class="j">Where have ye laid him?</span> They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Jesus wept.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</verse>
    <verse num="37">And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</verse>
    <verse num="38">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
    <verse num="39">Jesus said, <span class="j">Take ye away the stone.</span> Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been <i>dead</i> four days.</verse>
    <verse num="40">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? </span></verse>
    <verse num="41">Then they took away the stone <i>from the place</i> where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up <i>his</i> eyes, and said, <span class="j">Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="42"><span class="j">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said <i>it,</i> that they may believe that thou hast sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="43">And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, <span class="j">Lazarus, come forth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="44">And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Loose him, and let him go. </span></verse>
    <verse num="45">Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</verse>
    <verse num="46">But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</verse>
    <verse num="47">Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</verse>
    <verse num="48">If we let him thus alone, all <i>men</i> will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</verse>
    <verse num="49">And one of them, <i>named</i> Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</verse>
    <verse num="50">Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
    <verse num="51">And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</verse>
    <verse num="52">And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</verse>
    <verse num="53">Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</verse>
    <verse num="54">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</verse>
    <verse num="55">And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="56">Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</verse>
    <verse num="57">Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew <i>it,</i> that they might take him.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
    <verse num="2">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <i>son,</i> which should betray him,</verse>
    <verse num="5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</verse>
    <verse num="6">This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then said Jesus, <span class="j">Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9">Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</verse>
    <verse num="11">Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="12">On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
    <verse num="13">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed <i>is</i> the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</verse>
    <verse num="15">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.</verse>
    <verse num="16">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and <i>that</i> they had done these things unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="17">The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</verse>
    <verse num="19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</verse>
    <verse num="21">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Jesus answered them, saying, <span class="j">The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. </span></verse>
    <verse num="24"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. </span></verse>
    <verse num="25"><span class="j">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. </span></verse>
    <verse num="26"><span class="j">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will <i>my</i> Father honour. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27"><span class="j">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28"><span class="j">Father, glorify thy name.</span> Then came there a voice from heaven, <i>saying,</i> I have both glorified <i>it,</i> and will glorify <i>it</i> again.</verse>
    <verse num="29">The people therefore, that stood by, and heard <i>it,</i> said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Jesus answered and said, <span class="j">This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. </span></verse>
    <verse num="31"><span class="j">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <i>men</i> unto me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="33">This he said, signifying what death he should die.</verse>
    <verse num="34">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, <span class="j">The Son of man must be lifted up?</span> who is this Son of man?</verse>
    <verse num="35">Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="j">Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. </span></verse>
    <verse num="36"><span class="j">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</span> These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</verse>
    <verse num="37">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</verse>
    <verse num="38">That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
    <verse num="39">Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</verse>
    <verse num="40">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with <i>their</i> eyes, nor understand with <i>their</i> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
    <verse num="41">These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</verse>
    <verse num="42">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <i>him,</i> lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
    <verse num="43">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
    <verse num="44">Jesus cried and said, <span class="j">He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="45"><span class="j">And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="46"><span class="j">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. </span></verse>
    <verse num="47"><span class="j">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. </span></verse>
    <verse num="48"><span class="j">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. </span></verse>
    <verse num="49"><span class="j">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. </span></verse>
    <verse num="50"><span class="j">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>

  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <i>son,</i> to betray him;</verse>
    <verse num="3">Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</verse>
    <verse num="4">He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</verse>
    <verse num="5">After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe <i>them</i> with the towel wherewith he was girded.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</verse>
    <verse num="7">Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="j">What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8">Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, <span class="j">If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9">Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also <i>my</i> hands and <i>my</i> head.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Jesus saith to him, <span class="j">He that is washed needeth not save to wash <i>his</i> feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11">For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, <span class="j">Ye are not all clean. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12">So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, <span class="j">Know ye what I have done to you? </span></verse>
    <verse num="13"><span class="j">Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. </span></verse>
    <verse num="14"><span class="j">If I then, <i>your</i> Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet. </span></verse>
    <verse num="15"><span class="j">For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17"><span class="j">If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19"><span class="j">Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am <i>he. </i></span></verse>
    <verse num="20"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="21">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, <span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22">Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</verse>
    <verse num="25">He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</verse>
    <verse num="26">Jesus answered, <span class="j">He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped <i>it.</i></span> And when he had dipped the sop, he gave <i>it</i> to Judas Iscariot, <i>the son</i> of Simon.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="j">That thou doest, do quickly. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28">Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="29">For some <i>of them</i> thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy <i>those things</i> that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</verse>
    <verse num="30">He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, <span class="j">Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="32"><span class="j">If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. </span></verse>
    <verse num="33"><span class="j">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="34"><span class="j">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. </span></verse>
    <verse num="35"><span class="j">By this shall all <i>men</i> know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="36">Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, <span class="j">Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37">Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</verse>
    <verse num="38">Jesus answered him, <span class="j">Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>

    <verse num="5">Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</verse>

    <verse num="22">Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</verse>
    <verse num="23">Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="j">If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. </span></verse>

    <verse num="3"><span class="j">And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. </span></verse>
    <verse num="4"><span class="j">I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. </span></verse>
    <verse num="5"><span class="j">And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. </span></verse>
    <verse num="6"><span class="j">I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. </span></verse>
    <verse num="7"><span class="j">Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. </span></verse>
    <verse num="8"><span class="j">For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received <i>them,</i> and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="9"><span class="j">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. </span></verse>

    <verse num="11"><span class="j">And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we <i>are. </i></span></verse>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="18">
    <verse num="1">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Judas then, having received a band <i>of men</i> and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, <span class="j">Whom seek ye? </span></verse>
    <verse num="5">They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">I am <i>he.</i></span> And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</verse>
    <verse num="6">As soon then as he had said unto them, <span class="j">I am <i>he,</i></span> they went backward, and fell to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then asked he them again, <span class="j">Whom seek ye?</span> And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Jesus answered, <span class="j">I have told you that I am <i>he:</i> if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: </span></verse>
    <verse num="9">That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, <span class="j">Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none. </span></verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then said Jesus unto Peter, <span class="j">Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? </span></verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</verse>
    <verse num="13">And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and <i>so did</i> another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</verse>
    <verse num="16">But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also <i>one</i> of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</verse>
    <verse num="19">The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Jesus answered him, <span class="j">I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. </span></verse>
    <verse num="21"><span class="j">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22">And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</verse>
    <verse num="23">Jesus answered him, <span class="j">If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? </span></verse>
    <verse num="24">Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also <i>one</i> of his disciples? He denied <i>it,</i> and said, I am not.</verse>
    <verse num="26">One of the servants of the high priest, being <i>his</i> kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</verse>
    <verse num="27">Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</verse>
    <verse num="30">They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</verse>
    <verse num="32">That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</verse>
    <verse num="34">Jesus answered him, <span class="j">Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? </span></verse>
    <verse num="35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</verse>
    <verse num="36">Jesus answered, <span class="j">My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. </span></verse>
    <verse num="37">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, <span class="j">Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. </span></verse>
    <verse num="38">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault <i>at all. </i></verse>
    <verse num="39">But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</verse>
    <verse num="40">Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged <i>him. </i></verse>
    <verse num="2">And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put <i>it</i> on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</verse>
    <verse num="3">And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And <i>Pilate</i> saith unto them, Behold the man!</verse>
    <verse num="6">When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify <i>him,</i> crucify <i>him.</i> Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify <i>him:</i> for I find no fault in him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
    <verse num="8">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</verse>
    <verse num="9">And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</verse>
    <verse num="11">Jesus answered, <span class="j">Thou couldest have no power <i>at all</i> against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. </span></verse>
    <verse num="12">And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</verse>
    <verse num="13">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</verse>
    <verse num="15">But they cried out, Away with <i>him,</i> away with <i>him,</i> crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led <i>him</i> away.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called <i>the place</i> of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</verse>
    <verse num="18">Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Pilate wrote a title, and put <i>it</i> on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
    <verse num="20">This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, <i>and</i> Greek, <i>and</i> Latin.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also <i>his</i> coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
    <verse num="24">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the <i>wife</i> of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
    <verse num="26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, <span class="j">Woman, behold thy son! </span></verse>
    <verse num="27">Then saith he to the disciple, <span class="j">Behold thy mother!</span> And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own <i>home.</i></verse>
    <verse num="28">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, <span class="j">I thirst. </span></verse>
    <verse num="29">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put <i>it</i> upon hyssop, and put <i>it</i> to his mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, <span class="j">It is finished:</span> and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</verse>
    <verse num="31">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <i>that</i> they might be taken away.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</verse>
    <verse num="33">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</verse>
    <verse num="34">But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And he that saw <i>it</i> bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</verse>
    <verse num="36">For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</verse>
    <verse num="38">And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave <i>him</i> leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound <i>weight. </i></verse>
    <verse num="40">Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
    <verse num="41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</verse>
    <verse num="42">There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation <i>day;</i> for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">The first <i>day</i> of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he stooping down, <i>and looking in,</i> saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, <i>and looked</i> into the sepulchre,</verse>
    <verse num="12">And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?</span> She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">Mary.</span> She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Jesus saith unto her, <span class="j">Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and <i>to</i> my God, and your God. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and <i>that</i> he had spoken these things unto her.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then the same day at evening, being the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, <span class="j">Peace <i>be</i> unto you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20">And when he had so said, he shewed unto them <i>his</i> hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then said Jesus to them again, <span class="j">Peace <i>be</i> unto you: as <i>my</i> Father hath sent me, even so send I you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="22">And when he had said this, he breathed on <i>them,</i> and saith unto them, <span class="j">Receive ye the Holy Ghost: </span></verse>
    <verse num="23"><span class="j">Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; <i>and</i> whose soever <i>sins</i> ye retain, they are retained. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
    <verse num="25">The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: <i>then</i> came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, <span class="j">Peace <i>be</i> unto you. </span></verse>
    <verse num="27">Then saith he to Thomas, <span class="j">reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust <i>it</i> into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. </span></verse>
    <verse num="28">And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed <i>are</i> they that have not seen, and <i>yet</i> have believed. </span><span class="j"></span></verse>
    <verse num="30">And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</verse>
    <verse num="31">But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he <i>himself. </i></verse>
    <verse num="2">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Children, have ye any meat?</span> They answered him, No.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he said unto them, <span class="j">Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</span> They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt <i>his</i> fisher’s coat <i>unto him,</i> (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</verse>
    <verse num="9">As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. </span></verse>
    <verse num="11">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Jesus saith unto them, <span class="j">Come <i>and</i> dine.</span> And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</verse>
    <verse num="14">This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, <span class="j">Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="j">Feed my lambs. </span></verse>
    <verse num="16">He saith to him again the second time, <span class="j">Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="j">Feed my sheep. </span></verse>
    <verse num="17">He saith unto him the third time, <span class="j">Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">Feed my sheep. </span></verse>
    <verse num="18"><span class="j">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <i>thee</i> whither thou wouldest not. </span></verse>
    <verse num="19">This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, <span class="j">Follow me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</verse>
    <verse num="21">Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <i>shall</i> this man <i>do? </i></verse>
    <verse num="22">Jesus saith unto him, <span class="j">If I will that he tarry till I come, what <i>is that</i> to thee? follow thou me. </span></verse>
    <verse num="23">Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, <span class="j">If I will that he tarry till I come, what <i>is that</i> to thee? </span></verse>
    <verse num="24">This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
