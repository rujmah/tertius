    <verse num="7">On the twenty-fourth day of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the prophet, son of Berekiah, son of Iddo, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="8">{I had a vision in the night},<note>Literally "I saw the night," which means "I had a vision"</note> and look, a man riding on a red horse.

    <verse num="9">And I asked, "What <transChange type="added">are</transChange> these, my lord?" And the angel <transChange type="added">who was</transChange> talking with me said, "I will show you what these are."</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the man standing between the myrtle shrubs answered and said, "These <transChange type="added">are</transChange> those whom Yahweh has sent to patrol<note>Or "to go about," or "to walk through"</note> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> earth."</verse>
    <verse num="11">And they answered the angel of Yahweh who was standing between the myrtle shrubs, and they said, "We have patrolled<note>Or "have gone about," or "have walked through"</note> the earth, and look, all the earth {is dwelling in peace}."<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">is</transChange> dwelling and <transChange type="added">is</transChange> at rest"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">The angel of Yahweh answered and said, "O Yahweh of hosts, {how long}<note>Literally "until when"</note> will you have no compassion on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> which you showed fury these seventy years?"<note>Hebrew "year"</note></verse>
    <verse num="13"><transChange type="added">With</transChange> gracious<note>Or "kind"; literally "good"</note> and comforting words Yahweh answered the angel who was talking with me.</verse>
