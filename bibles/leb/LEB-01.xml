  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth--</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now<note>Or "And"</note> the earth was formless and empty, and darkness <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God <transChange type="added">was</transChange> hovering over the surface of the waters.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And God said, "Let there be light!" And there was light.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And God saw the light, that <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> good, and God caused <transChange type="added">there to be</transChange> a separation between the light and between the darkness.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> first day. </verse>
    <verse num="6">And God said, "Let there be a vaulted dome<note>Or "expanse"</note> in the midst of the waters, and {let it cause a separation between the waters}."<note>Literally "Let there be a separation made between waters to waters"</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">So<note>Or "And"</note> God made the vaulted dome,<note>Or "expanse"</note> and he caused a separation between the waters which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> under the vaulted dome<note>Or "expanse"</note> and between the waters which were over the vaulted dome.<note>Or "expanse"</note> And it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And God called the vaulted dome<note>Or "expanse"</note> "heaven."<note>Or "sky"</note> And there was evening, and there was morning, a second day. </verse>
    <verse num="9">And God said, "Let the waters under heaven<note>Or "the sky"</note> be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear." And it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And God called the dry ground "earth," and he called the collection of the waters "seas." And God saw that <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> good.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And God said, "Let the earth produce green plants <transChange type="added">that will</transChange> bear seed--fruit trees bearing fruit {in which there is seed}<note>Literally "which its seed <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in it"</note>--according to its<note>Or "their"</note> kind, on the earth." And it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the earth brought forth green plants bearing seed according to its<note>Or "their"</note> kind, and trees bearing fruit {in which there was seed}<note>Literally "which its seed <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in it"</note> according to its<note>Or "their"</note> kind. And God saw that <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> good.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. </verse>
    <verse num="14">And God said, "Let there be lights<note>Or "light sources"</note> in the vaulted dome<note>Or "expanse"</note> of heaven<note>Or "the sky"</note> {to separate day from night},<note>Literally "to make a separation between the day and between the night"</note> and let them be as signs and for appointed times, and for days and years,</verse>
    <verse num="15">and they shall be as lights<note>Or "light sources"</note> in the vaulted dome<note>Or "expanse"</note> of heaven<note>Or "the sky"</note> to give light on the earth." And it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> so.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And God made two lights,<note>Or "light sources"</note> the greater light<note>Or "light source"</note> to rule<note>Literally "as the authority of"</note> the day and the smaller light<note>Or "light source"</note> to rule<note>Literally "as the authority of"</note> the night, and the stars.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And God placed them in the vaulted dome<note>Or "expanse"</note> of heaven<note>Or "the sky"</note> to give light on the earth</verse>
    <verse num="18">and to rule over the day and over the night, and to {separate light from darkness}.<note>Literally "make a separation between the light and between the darkness"</note> And God saw that <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> good.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. </verse>
    <verse num="20">And God said, "Let the waters swarm <transChange type="added">with</transChange> swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly over the earth across the face of the vaulted dome<note>Or "expanse"</note> of heaven.<note>Or "the sky"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">So<note>Or "And"</note> God created the great sea creatures and every living creature <transChange type="added">that</transChange> moves, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> which the waters swarm, according to their kind, and every bird <transChange type="added">with</transChange> wings according to its<note>Or "their"</note> kind. And God saw that <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> good.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."</verse>
    <verse num="23">And there was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day. </verse>
    <verse num="24">And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind: cattle and moving things, and wild animals<note>Literally "animals of the earth/land"</note> according to their kind." And it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="25">So<note>Or "And"</note> God made wild animals<note>Literally "animals of the earth/land"</note> according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind, and every creeping thing of the earth according to its<note>Or "their"</note> kind. And God saw that <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> good. </verse>
    <verse num="26">And God said, "Let us make humankind in<note>Or "as"</note> our image and according to<note>Or "as"</note> our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of heaven,<note>Or "the sky"</note> and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every moving thing that moves upon the earth."</verse>
    <verse num="27">So<note>Or "And"</note> God created humankind in<note>Or "as"</note> his image, in<note>Or "as"</note> the likeness of God he created him,<note>Or "it" <transChange type="added">collective: humankind</transChange></note> male and female he created them.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of heaven,<note>Or "the sky"</note> and over every animal that moves upon the earth." </verse>
    <verse num="29">And God said, "Look--I am giving to you every plant <transChange type="added">that</transChange> bears seed which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on the face of the whole earth, and every kind of tree {that bears fruit}.<note>Literally "which in it fruit of a tree bears seed"</note> They shall be yours as food."</verse>
    <verse num="30">And to every kind of animal of the earth and to every bird of heaven,<note>Or "the sky"</note> and to everything that moves upon the earth in which <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> life <transChange type="added">I am giving</transChange> every green plant as food." And it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And God saw everything that he had made and, behold, <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, a sixth day. </verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">And heaven<note>Or "the sky"</note> and earth<note>Or "the earth"</note> and all their array<note>Or "host"</note> were finished.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and he sanctified<note>Or "hallowed"</note> it, because on it he rested from all his work {of creating that <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> to do}.<note>Literally "which God created to do"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="4">These are the generations<note>Or "family records"</note> of heaven<note>Or "the sky"</note> and earth<note>Or "the earth"</note> when they were created, in the day <transChange type="added">that</transChange> Yahweh God made earth and heaven<note>Or "sky"</note>--</verse>
    <verse num="5">{before any plant of the field was}<note>Literally "and every plant of the field not yet was"</note> on earth, and <transChange type="added">before</transChange> {any plant of the field}<note>Literally "and every plant of the field not yet"</note> had sprung up, because Yahweh God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no human being to cultivate the ground,</verse>
    <verse num="6">but a stream <transChange type="added">would</transChange> rise from the earth and water the whole face of the ground--</verse>
    <verse num="7">when<note>Or "and"</note> Yahweh God formed the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> <transChange type="added">of</transChange> dust from the ground, and he blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. </verse>
    <verse num="8">And Yahweh God planted a garden in Eden in the east, and there he put the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> whom he had formed.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Yahweh God caused to grow every tree <transChange type="added">that</transChange> was pleasing to the sight and good for food. And the tree of life <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the midst of the garden, {along with}<note>Or "and"</note> the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </verse>
    <verse num="10">Now<note>Or "And"</note> a river flowed out from Eden that watered the garden, and from there it diverged and became four branches.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The name of the first <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the Pishon. It went around all the land of Havilah, where <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> gold.</verse>
    <verse num="12">(The gold of that land <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good; bdellium and onyx stones <transChange type="added">are</transChange> there.)</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the name of the second <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Gihon. It went around all the land of Cush.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the name of the third <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Tigris. It flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the Euphrates. </verse>
    <verse num="15">And Yahweh God took the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> and set him in the garden of Eden to cultivate it and to keep it.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Yahweh God commanded the man,<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> saying, "From every tree of the garden {you may freely eat},<note>Literally "eating you may eat"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day {that you eat}<note>Literally "of your eating"</note> from it {you shall surely die}."<note>Literally "dying you shall die"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="18">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Yahweh God said, "<transChange type="added">it is</transChange> not good <transChange type="added">that</transChange> the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> is alone. I will make for him a helper {as his counterpart}."<note>Literally "as his opposite"</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">And out of the ground Yahweh God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky,<note>Or "the heavens"</note> and he brought <transChange type="added">each</transChange> to the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> to see what he would call it. And whatever the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> called that living creature <transChange type="added">was</transChange> its name.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> {gave names}<note>Literally "called names"</note> to every domesticated animal and to the birds of heaven<note>Or "the sky"</note> and to all the wild animals.<note>Literally "animals of the earth/land"</note> But for <transChange type="added">the</transChange> man there was not found a helper {as his counterpart}.<note>Literally "as his opposite"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">And Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man.<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> While<note>Or "And"</note> he slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up {the flesh where it had been}.<note>Literally "the flesh in the place of it"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">And Yahweh God fashioned the rib which he had taken from the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> into a woman and brought her to the man.<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note></verse>
    <verse num="23">And the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> said, </verse>
    <verse num="24">Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cling to his wife, and they shall be as one flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> and his wife, both of them, were naked, and they were not ashamed. </verse>

  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Now the serpent was more crafty than any other {wild animal}<note>Literally "animal of the field"</note> which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God indeed say, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?"</verse>
    <verse num="2">The woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,</verse>
    <verse num="3">but from the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God said, 'You shall not eat from it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die'."</verse>
    <verse num="4">But the serpent said to the woman, "You shall not surely die.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For God knows that on the day you <transChange type="added">both</transChange> eat from it, then your eyes will be opened and you <transChange type="added">both</transChange> shall be like gods,<note>The plural is in the context of v. 22 <transChange type="added">"one of us"</transChange> and the plural suffix pronouns <transChange type="added">["you [all</transChange>"]] throughout the verse</note> knowing good and evil."</verse>
    <verse num="6">When<note>Or "And"</note> the woman saw that the tree <transChange type="added">was</transChange> good for food and that it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a delight to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make <transChange type="added">one</transChange> wise, then<note>Or "and"</note> she took from its fruit and she ate. And she gave <transChange type="added">it</transChange> also to her husband with her, and he ate.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then<note>Or "And"</note> the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> naked. And they sewed together fig leaves and they made for themselves coverings. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Then<note>Or "And"</note> they heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden {at the windy time of day}.<note>Literally "at the wind of the day"</note> And the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Yahweh God called to the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> and said to him, "Where <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you?"</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he replied,<note>Literally "And he said"; "replied" distinguishes Adam as the speaker</note> "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid because I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> naked, so I hid myself."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then he<note>That is, Yahweh God</note> asked,<note>Or "said"</note> "Who told you that you <transChange type="added">were</transChange> naked?

    <verse num="12">And the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> replied,<note>Or "said"</note> "The woman whom you gave <transChange type="added">to be</transChange> with me--she gave to me from the tree and I ate."</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Yahweh God said to the woman, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this you have done?" And the woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Yahweh God said to the serpent, </verse>
    <verse num="15">And I will put hostility between you and between the woman, and between your offspring<note>Literally "seed"</note> and between her offspring;<note>Literally "seed"</note> he will strike you <transChange type="added">on the</transChange> head, and you will strike him <transChange type="added">on the</transChange> heel."</verse>
    <verse num="16">To the woman he said, </verse>
    <verse num="17">And to Adam<note>The noun lacks the definite article and is taken as a proper noun in this context</note> he said, "Because you listened to the voice of your wife and you ate from the tree {from which I forbade you to eat},<note>Literally "from the tree which I commanded saying not to eat from it"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="18">And thorns and thistles shall sprout for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.</verse>
    <verse num="19">By the sweat of your brow<note>Literally "your face"</note> you shall eat bread, until your return to the ground. For from it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return."</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the man<note>"The man" indicates the noun is singular and occurs with the definite article</note> {named}<note>Literally "called the name"</note> his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all life.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Yahweh God made for Adam<note>The noun lacks the definite article and is taken as a proper noun in this context</note> and for his wife garments of skin, and he clothed them. </verse>
    <verse num="22">And Yahweh God said, "Look--the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil. {What if}<note>Literally "And now lest"</note> he stretches out his hand and takes also from the tree of life and eats, and lives forever?"</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
    <verse num="24">So<note>Or "And"</note> he drove the man out, and placed cherubim east of the garden of Eden, and {a flaming, turning sword}<note>Literally "a flame of the sword which was turning"</note> to guard the way to the tree of life. </verse>

  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Now Adam knew<note>Or "had intercourse with"</note> Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain. And she said, "I have given birth to a man with <transChange type="added">the help of</transChange> Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="2">{Then she bore}<note>Literally "And she added to bear"</note> his brother Abel. And Abel became a keeper of sheep, and Cain became a tiller of the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And {in the course of time}<note>Literally "it came to pass at the end of days"</note> Cain brought an offering from the fruit of the ground to Yahweh,</verse>
    <verse num="4">and Abel also brought <transChange type="added">an offering</transChange> from {the choicest firstlings of his flock}.<note>Literally "from the firstlings of his flock and from their fat"</note> And Yahweh looked with favor to Abel and to his offering,</verse>
    <verse num="5">but to Cain and to his offering he did not look with favor. And Cain became very angry, and his face fell.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why is your face fallen?</verse>
    <verse num="7">If you do well {will I not accept you}?<note>Literally "a lifting up"; this is an abbreviation of the Hebrew idiom "to lift up the face," which means "to accept or regard with favor"</note> But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. And its desire <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for you, but you must rule over it." </verse>
    <verse num="8">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Cain said to his brother Abel, <transChange type="added">"Let us go out into the field."</transChange><note>This phrase is not present in the Hebrew; it is supplied in other versions <transChange type="added">Samaritan, Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate</transChange></note> And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Yahweh said to Cain, "Where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive the blood of your brother from your hand.</verse>
    <verse num="12">When you till the ground {it shall no longer yield its strength to you}.<note>Literally "it shall not add to give its strength to you"</note> You shall be a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth."</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment <transChange type="added">is</transChange> greater than <transChange type="added">I can</transChange> bear.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Look, you have driven me out today from the face of the ground, and from your face I must hide. I will be a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Yahweh said to him, "Therefore, whoever kills Cain will be avenged sevenfold." Then<note>Or "And"</note> Yahweh put a sign on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh, and he settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. </verse>
    <verse num="17">And Cain knew<note>Or "had intercourse with"</note> his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. And when he built a city {he named the city after his son, Enoch}.<note>Literally "he called the name of the city as the name of his son, Enoch"</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.</verse>

    <verse num="20">And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and <transChange type="added">those who have</transChange> livestock.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the name of his brother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and wind instruments.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain who forged all <transChange type="added">kinds of</transChange> tools of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Naamah. </verse>
    <verse num="23">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Lamech said to his wives, </verse>
    <verse num="24">If Cain is avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech <transChange type="added">will be avenged</transChange> seventy and seven <transChange type="added">times</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Adam knew<note>Or "had intercourse with"</note> his wife again, and she gave birth to a son.

    <verse num="26">And as for Seth, he also fathered a son, and he called his name Enosh. At that time he<note>Or "humankind," if the 3ms form is considered collective</note> began to call on the name of Yahweh. </verse>

  <chapter num="18">
    <verse num="1">And Yahweh appeared to him<note>Abraham</note> by the oaks of Mamre. And he was sitting in the doorway of the tent at the heat of the day.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing near<note>Or "by"; the context requires some distance for Abraham to run to them</note> him. And he saw <transChange type="added">them</transChange> and ran from the doorway of the tent to meet them. And he bowed down to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he said, "My lord, if I have found favor in your eyes do not pass by your servant.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest under the tree.</verse>

    <verse num="6">Then<note>Or "And"</note> Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and he said, "Quickly--make three seahs of fine flour for kneading and make bread cakes!"</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Abraham ran to the cattle and took a {calf},<note>Literally "a son of cattle"</note> tender and good, and gave it to the servant, and he made haste to prepare it.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then he took curds and milk, and the calf which he prepared, and set <transChange type="added">it</transChange> before them. And he was standing by them under the tree while<note>Or "and"</note> they ate.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they said to him, "Where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Sarah your wife?" And he said, "Here, in the tent."</verse>

    <verse num="11">Now Abraham and Sarah <transChange type="added">were</transChange> old, {advanced in age};<note>Literally "going in the days"</note> {the way of women}<note>Literally "the road according to women"</note> had ceased to be for Sarah.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So<note>Or "And"</note> Sarah laughed to herself saying, "After I am worn out and my husband is old, shall <transChange type="added">this</transChange> pleasure be to me?"</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Yahweh said to Abraham, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this <transChange type="added">that</transChange> Sarah laughed, saying, 'Is it indeed true <transChange type="added">that</transChange> I will bear a child, now <transChange type="added">that</transChange> I have grown old?'</verse>

    <verse num="26">And Yahweh said, "If I find fifty righteous in Sodom, in the midst of the city, then I will forgive the whole place for their sake."</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then Abraham answered and said, "Look, please, I was bold to speak to my Lord, but I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> dust and ashes.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Perhaps the fifty righteous are lacking five--will you destroy the whole city on account of the five?" And he answered, "I will not destroy <transChange type="added">it</transChange> if I find forty-five there."</verse>
    <verse num="29">And {once again he spoke}<note>Literally "And he added again to speak"</note> to him and said, "What if<note>Or "Perhaps"</note> forty are found there?" And he answered, "I will not do <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on account of the forty."</verse>
    <verse num="30">And he said, "Please, let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if<note>Or "Perhaps"</note> thirty be found there?" And he answered, "I will not do <transChange type="added">it</transChange> if I find thirty there."</verse>
    <verse num="31">And he said, "Please, now, I was bold to speak to my Lord. What if<note>Or "Perhaps"</note> twenty be found there?" And he answered, "I will not destroy <transChange type="added">it</transChange> for the sake of the twenty."</verse>
    <verse num="32">And he said, "Please, let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak only once more. What if<note>Or "Perhaps"</note> ten are found there?" And he answered, "I will not destroy <transChange type="added">it</transChange> for the sake of the ten."</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then Yahweh left,<note>Or "went"</note> as he finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place. </verse>

  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening. And Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom. Then Lot saw <transChange type="added">them</transChange> and stood up to meet them. And he bowed down <transChange type="added">with his</transChange> face to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he said, "Behold, my lords, please turn aside into the house of your servant and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you can rise early and go on your way." And they said, "No, but we will spend the night in the square."</verse>
    <verse num="3">But {he urged them strongly},<note>Literally "he pressed upon them very"</note> and they turned aside with him and came into his house. And he made a meal for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Before they laid down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people {to the last man},<note>Literally "from the end"</note> surrounded the house.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they called to Lot and said to him, "Where <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know<note>Hebrew idiom for sexual intercourse (cp. Gen 4:1)</note> them."</verse>
    <verse num="6">But Lot went out to them at the entrance, and he shut the door behind him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he said, "No, my brothers, please do not do <transChange type="added">such a</transChange> wrong <transChange type="added">thing</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Behold, I have two daughters who have not known<note>Hebrew idiom for sexual intercourse (cp. Gen 4:1)</note> a man.

    <verse num="9">But they said, "Step aside!" Then they said, "{This fellow}<note>Literally "the one"</note> came to dwell as a foreigner and he acts as a judge! Now we shall do worse to you than them!" And they pressed very hard against the man, against Lot, and they drew near to break the door.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the men reached out <transChange type="added">with</transChange> their hands and brought Lot in to them, into the house, and they shut the door.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> at the entrance of the house they struck with blindness, both small and great, and they were unable to find the entrance.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the men said to Lot, "Who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> here with you?

    <verse num="13">For we are <transChange type="added">about to</transChange> destroy this place, because their cry has become great before Yahweh. Yahweh sent us to destroy it."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> taking<note>That is, marrying</note> his daughters and said, "Get up! Go out from this place, because Yahweh <transChange type="added">is going</transChange> to destroy the city!" But {it seemed like a joke}<note>Literally "it was as one making fun"</note> in the eyes of his sons-in-law.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And as the dawn came up the angels urged Lot saying, "Get up, take your wife and your two daughters {who are staying with you},<note>Literally "who are found"</note> lest you be destroyed with the punishment of the city."</verse>
    <verse num="16">But <transChange type="added">when</transChange> he lingered, the men seized him by his hand and his wife's hand, and his two daughters by hand, on account of the mercy of Yahweh upon him. And they brought him out and set him outside of the city.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And after bringing them outside <transChange type="added">one</transChange> said, "Flee for your life; do not look behind you, and do not stand anywhere in the plain. Flee to the mountains lest you be destroyed."</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Lot said to them, "No, please, my lords.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Behold, your servant has found favor in your eyes and {you have shown me great kindness}<note>Literally "your kindness which you have done to me you have made great"</note> in saving my life. But I cannot flee to the mountains, lest the disaster overtake me and I die.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Behold, this city <transChange type="added">is</transChange> near <transChange type="added">enough</transChange> to flee there, and it <transChange type="added">is a</transChange> little <transChange type="added">one</transChange>.

    <verse num="21">And he said to him, "Behold, {I will grant this favor as well};<note>Literally "I am lifting up your face also concerning this thing"</note> that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Escape there quickly, for I cannot do <transChange type="added">this</transChange> thing until you get there." Therefore, there name of the city was called Zoar. </verse>
    <verse num="23"><transChange type="added">After</transChange> the sun {had risen}<note>Literally "had gone out"</note> upon the earth and Lot had entered Zoar,</verse>
    <verse num="24">Yahweh rained down from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And he overthrew those cities and the whole plain, and the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation of the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="26">But his<note>That is, Lot's</note> wife looked {back},<note>Literally "behind him"</note> and she became a pillar of salt.</verse>

    <verse num="29">So it was, when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out from the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived. </verse>
    <verse num="30">And Lot went out from Zoar and settled in the hill country<note>Or "mountain"</note> with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. So he lived in a cave, he and his two daughters.</verse>

    <verse num="35">And they gave their father wine to drink again that night, and the younger got up and lay with him, but he did not know when she lay down or when she got up.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And the two daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.</verse>
    <verse num="37">The firstborn gave birth to a son, and she called his name Moab. He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the father of Moab until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="38">And the younger, she also gave birth to a son, and she called his name Ben-Ammi. He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the father of the {Ammonites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> until this day. </verse>

  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">And Abraham journeyed from there to the land of the Negev, and he settled between Kadesh and Shur. And he dwelled as an alien in Gerar.</verse>

    <verse num="4">Now Abimelech had not approached her, so he said, "my Lord, will you even kill a righteous people?"</verse>
    <verse num="5">Did not he himself say to me, 'She <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my sister'? And she herself said, 'He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my brother.' With integrity of my heart and with cleanness of my hands I did this."</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes,<note>Or "Also"</note> I know that in the integrity of your heart you did this, and I also {kept you from sinning}<note>Literally "kept back from sinning"</note> against me. Therefore, I did not allow you to touch her.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So now, return the wife of the man, for he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a prophet, so that he will pray for you and you will live.

    <verse num="8">So Abimelech rose early in the morning. And he called all his servants and {told them all these things},<note>Literally "said all these things in their ears"</note> and the men were very afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Abimelech called for Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you that you brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done things to me that should not be done."</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Abimelech said to Abraham, "{What were you thinking}<note>Literally "What have you seen?"</note> that you did this thing?"</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Abraham said, "Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place; they will kill me on account of the matter of my wife.</verse>

  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">And Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said. And Yahweh did to Sarah as he had promised.</verse>

    <verse num="7">And she said, "Who would announce to Abraham <transChange type="added">that</transChange> Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne a son <transChange type="added">to Abraham</transChange> in his old age." </verse>
    <verse num="8">And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne Abraham, mocking.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then she said to Abraham, "Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman will not be heir with my son, with Isaac."</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the matter {displeased Abraham very much}<note>Literally "was very bad in the eyes of Abraham"</note> on account of his son.</verse>

    <verse num="13">And I will also make the son of the slave woman into a nation, for he is your offspring."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to Hagar, putting <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on her shoulder. And he sent her away with the child, and she went, wandering about in the wilderness, in Beersheba.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when the water was finished from the skin, she put the child under one of the bushes.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And she went and {she sat a good distance away},<note>Literally "she sat with respect to her, opposite, far away, as the shooting of a bow"</note> for she said, "Let me not see the child's death." So she sat away from him and lifted up her voice and wept.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And God heard the cry<note>Or "voice"</note> of the boy and the angel of God called to Hagar from the heavens and said to her, "{What is the matter}<note>Literally "What to you"</note> Hagar?

    <verse num="18">Get up, take up the boy and take him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation."</verse>
    <verse num="19">And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave a drink to the boy.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And God was with the boy, and he grew and lived in the wilderness. And he became {an expert with a bow}.<note>Literally "an archer with the bow"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">And he lived in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt. </verse>
    <verse num="22">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, "God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with you, in all that you do.</verse>

    <verse num="24">And Abraham said, "I swear."</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Abraham complained to Abimelech on account of the well of water that servants of Abimelech had seized.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Abimelech said, "I do not know who did this thing, neither did you tell me, nor have I heard <transChange type="added">of it</transChange> except for today."</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to Abimelech. And the two of them {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then Abraham set <transChange type="added">off</transChange> seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What <transChange type="added">is the meaning of</transChange> these seven ewe-lambs that you have set <transChange type="added">off</transChange> by themselves?"</verse>

    <verse num="1">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> after these things, God tested Abraham. And he said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he said, "Take your son, your only child, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains where<note>Or "that"</note> I will tell you."</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his donkey. And he took two of his servants with him, and Isaac his son. And he chopped wood for a burnt offering. And he got up and went to the place which God had told him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and he saw the place at a distance.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Abraham said to his servants, "You stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go up there. We will worship, then we will return to you."</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and placed <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and the knife, and the two of them went together.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Isaac said to Abraham his father, "My father!" And he said, "Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>, my son." And he said, "Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Abraham said, "{God will provide}<note>Literally "God will see to it" or "God will see for himself"</note> the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went together. </verse>
    <verse num="9">And they came to the place that God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood. Then he bound Isaac his son and placed him on the altar atop the wood.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the angel of Yahweh called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham! Abraham!" And he said, "Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said, "Do not stretch out your hand against the boy; do not do anything to him. For now I know that you are {one who fears}<note>Literally "a fearer"</note> God, since you have not withheld your son, your only child, from me."</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked. And behold, a ram was caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Abraham called the name of that place "Yahweh {will provide},"<note>Literally "will see"</note> {for which reason}<note>Literally "which"</note> it is said today, "on the mountain of Yahweh {it shall be provided}."<note>Literally "it/he shall be seen"</note></verse>

    <verse num="19">And Abraham returned to his servants, and they got up and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived in Beersheba. </verse>
    <verse num="20">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> after these things, it was told to Abraham, "Look, Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor:</verse>

    <verse num="3">And Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. And Abraham rose up from his dead, and he spoke to the Hittites<note>Or "sons of Heth"</note> <transChange type="added">and</transChange> said,</verse>
    <verse num="4">"I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> a stranger and an alien among you; give to me {my own burial site}<note>Literally "ownership of a grave"</note> among you so that I may bury my dead from before me."</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the Hittites<note>Or "sons of Heth"</note> answered Abraham <transChange type="added">and</transChange> said to him,</verse>
    <verse num="6">"Hear us, my lord, you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> a mighty prince<note>Or "prince of God"</note> in our midst. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial sites.

    <verse num="7">And Abraham rose up and bowed to the people of the land, to the Hittites.<note>Or "sons of Heth"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">And he spoke with them, saying, "{If you are willing}<note>Literally "if there is with your inner selves / souls"</note> <transChange type="added">that</transChange> I bury my dead from before me, hear me and intercede for me with Ephron the son of Zohar,</verse>

    <verse num="10">Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites.<note>Or "sons of Heth"</note> And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites<note>Or "sons of Heth"</note> with respect to all <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> entering the gate of his city, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> said,</verse>
    <verse num="11">"No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field and the cave which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in it, I <transChange type="added">also</transChange> give it to you in the sight of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Abraham bowed before the people of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, "{If only you will hear me}<note>Literally "Only if you perhaps hear me"</note>--I give the price of the field.

    <verse num="14">And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,</verse>

    <verse num="16">Then Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he had named<note>Or "spoken"</note> in the hearing of the Hittites:<note>Or "sons of Heth"</note> four hundred shekels of silver {at the merchants' current rate}.<note>Literally "passing to the merchant"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">So the field of Ephron which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the Machpelah, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> near Mamre--the field and the cave which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in it, with all the trees that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the field, which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> within all its surrounding boundaries--{passed}<note>Literally "went up"</note></verse>

  <chapter num="24">
    <verse num="1">Now Abraham <transChange type="added">was</transChange> old, {advanced in age},<note>Literally "going in the days"</note> and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in everything.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all he had, "Please put your hand under my thigh</verse>

    <verse num="5">And the servant said to him, "Perhaps the woman will not be willing {to follow}<note>Literally "to go after"</note> me to this land--must I then return your son to the land from whence you came?"</verse>
    <verse num="6">Abraham said to him, "{You must take care}<note>Literally "let it be careful to you"</note> that you do not return my son there.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Yahweh, the God of heaven who took me from the house of my father and from the land of my family, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, 'to your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And if the woman is not willing {to follow}<note>Literally "to go after"</note> you, then you shall be released from this oath of mine--only you must not return my son there."</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and he swore to him concerning this matter.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the servant took ten camels from his master's camels, and he went with all <transChange type="added">kinds of</transChange> his master's good things in his hand. And he arose and went to Aram-Naharaim, to the city of Nahor.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he made the camels kneel outside the city at the well of water, at the time of evening, toward the time <transChange type="added">the women</transChange> went out to draw water.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said, "O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show loyal love to my master Abraham.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are going out to draw water.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And let it be <transChange type="added">that</transChange> the girl to whom I shall say, 'Please, offer your jar that I may drink' and <transChange type="added">who</transChange> says, 'Drink--and I will also water your camels,' she <transChange type="added">is the one</transChange> you have chosen for your servant, for Isaac.

    <verse num="15">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah--who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham--came out, and her jar <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on her shoulder.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Now the girl <transChange type="added">was</transChange> very pleasing in appearance. <transChange type="added">She was</transChange> a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the servant ran to meet her. And he said, "Please, let me drink a little of the water from your jar."</verse>
    <verse num="18">And she said, "Drink, my lord." And she quickly lowered her jar in her hand and gave him a drink.</verse>
    <verse num="19">When<note>Or "And"</note> she finished giving him a drink she said, "I will also draw water for your camels until they finish drinking."</verse>
    <verse num="20">And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water. And she drew water for all his camels.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the man <transChange type="added">was</transChange> gazing at her silently to know <transChange type="added">if</transChange> Yahweh had made his journey successful or not.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> as the camels finished drinking the man took a gold ring of a half shekel in weight and two bracelets for her arms, ten shekels in weight,</verse>
    <verse num="23">and said, "Please tell me, whose daughter <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you? Is there a place <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the house of your father for us to spend the night?"</verse>
    <verse num="24">And she said to him, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then she said to him, "We have both straw and fodder in abundance, as well as a place to spend the night."</verse>
    <verse num="26">And the man knelt down and worshiped Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And he said, "Blessed <transChange type="added">be</transChange> Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld<note>Or "abandoned"</note> his loyal love and his faithfulness from my master.

    <verse num="28">Then the girl ran and reported these things to the household of her mother. </verse>
    <verse num="29">Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Laban. And Laban ran out to the man toward the spring.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And when he saw the ring and the bracelets on the arms of his sister and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, <transChange type="added">who</transChange> said, "Thus the man spoke to me," he went to the man. And behold, <transChange type="added">he was</transChange> standing with the camels at the spring.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And he said, "Come, O blessed <transChange type="added">one</transChange> of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? Now I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."</verse>
    <verse num="32">And the man came to the house and unloaded the camels. And he gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="33">{And food was placed before him}<note>Literally "And it was placed before him"</note> to eat. And he said, "I will not eat until {I have told my errand}."<note>Literally "I have spoken my word"</note> And he said, "Speak."</verse>
    <verse num="34">And he said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> the servant of Abraham.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Now Yahweh has blessed my master exceedingly, and he has become great. He has given to him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male slaves and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And Sarah, the wife of my master, has borne a son to my master after her old age. And he<note>That is, Abraham</note> has given to him all that he has.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And my master made me swear, saying, 'Do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I am living.</verse>
    <verse num="38">But you shall go to the house of my father, and to my family, and you shall take a wife for my son.'</verse>
    <verse num="39">And I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not {follow}<note>Literally "go after"</note> me.'</verse>
    <verse num="40">And he said to me, 'Yahweh, before whom I have walked, shall send his angel with you and will make your journey successful. And you shall take a wife for my son from my family, and from the house of my father.</verse>

    <verse num="42">Then today I came to the spring, and I said, 'O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, {if you would please make my journey successful},<note>Literally "if there is you making successful my journey"</note> upon which I am going.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let it be <transChange type="added">that</transChange> the young woman who comes out to draw water and to whom I say, "Please give me a little water to drink from your jar,"</verse>
    <verse num="44">let her say to me, "Drink; I will also draw water for your camels," she <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for the son of my master.'</verse>

    <verse num="46">And she hastened and let down her jar {from her shoulder}<note>Literally "from upon her"</note> and said, 'Drink, and I will give a drink to your camels also.' Then I drank and she gave a drink to the camels also.</verse>
    <verse num="47">Then I asked her and said, 'Whose daughter <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you?' And she said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.' And I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.</verse>
    <verse num="48">And I knelt down and worshiped Yahweh, and I praised Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right way, to take the daughter of the brother of my master for his son.</verse>
    <verse num="49">So now, {if you are going to deal loyally and truly}<note>Literally "if there is you doing loyal love and faithfulness"</note> with my master, tell me.

    <verse num="53">And the servant brought out silver jewelry and gold jewelry, and garments, and he gave <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to Rebekah. And he gave precious gifts to her brother and to her mother.</verse>
    <verse num="54">And he and the men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him ate and drank, and they spent the night. And they got up in the morning, and he said, "Let me go to my master."</verse>
    <verse num="55">And her brother and her mother said, "Let the girl remain with us ten days <transChange type="added">or so</transChange>; after <transChange type="added">that</transChange> she may go."</verse>
    <verse num="56">And he said to them, "Do not delay me. Now, Yahweh has made my journey successful. Let me go. I must go to my master."</verse>
    <verse num="57">And they said, "Let us call the girl and ask {her opinion}."<note>Literally "her mouth"</note></verse>
    <verse num="58">And they called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go."</verse>
    <verse num="59">So they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and the servant of Abraham and his men.</verse>
    <verse num="60">And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> our sister; may you become countless thousands; and may your offspring take possession of the gate of his enemies."</verse>
    <verse num="61">And Rebekah and her maidservants arose, and they mounted the camels and {followed}<note>Literally "went after"</note> the man. And the servant took Rebekah and left. </verse>

    <verse num="25">And the first came out red, all {his body}<note>Literally "of him"</note> <transChange type="added">was</transChange> like a hairy coat, so they called his name Esau.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And afterward his brother came out, and his hand grasped the heel of Esau, so his name was called Jacob. And Isaac {was sixty years old}<note>Literally "a son of sixty years"</note> at their birth.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And the boys grew up. And Esau <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a skilled<note>Or "knowing" (knowledgeable)</note> hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a peaceful man, living <transChange type="added">in</transChange> tents.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Isaac loved Esau because {he could eat of his game},<note>Literally "game in his mouth"</note> but Rebekah loved Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Once<note>Or "and"</note> Jacob cooked a thick stew, and Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Esau said to Jacob, "Give me {some of that red stuff}<note>Literally "some of the red, this red"</note> to gulp down, for I am exhausted!" (Therefore his name was called Edom).</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then Jacob said, "Sell me your birthright {first}."<note>Literally "as the day"</note></verse>
    <verse num="32">And Esau said, "Look, I am going to die; now what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this birthright to me?"</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then Jacob said, "Swear to me {first}."<note>Literally "as the day"</note> And he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Then Jacob gave Esau bread, and thick lentil stew, and he ate and drank. Then he got up and went away. So Esau despised his birthright. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="26">
    <verse num="1">And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine which was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, to Gerar.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Yahweh appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land which I will show to you.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Dwell as an alien in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham you father.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and I will give to your descendants all these lands. And all nations of the earth will be blessed through your offspring,</verse>
    <verse num="5">because Abraham listened to my voice and kept my charge: my commandments, my statutes, and my laws." </verse>
    <verse num="6">So Isaac settled in Gerar.</verse>
    <verse num="7">When the men of the place asked concerning his wife, he said, "She <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my sister," for he was afraid to say, "my wife," thinking<note>Or "lest"</note> "the men of the place will kill me on account of Rebekah, for {she was beautiful}."<note>Literally "good of appearance"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange>, {when he had been there a long time},<note>Literally "when the days there were long to him"</note> Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked through the window, and saw--behold--Isaac <transChange type="added">was</transChange> fondling Rebekah his wife.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Abimelech called Isaac<note>Or "to Isaac"</note> and said, "Surely she <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your wife. Now why did you say 'She <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my sister'?" And Isaac said to him, "Because I thought I would die on account of her."</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Abimelech said, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have slept with your wife! Then you would have brought guilt upon us!"</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Abimelech instructed all the people, saying, "The <transChange type="added">one who</transChange> touches this man or his wife shall certainly die." </verse>
    <verse num="12">And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in that <transChange type="added">same</transChange> year a hundredfold, and Yahweh blessed him.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the man {became wealthier and wealthier}<note>Literally "became great and went, going and became great"</note> until he was exceedingly wealthy.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he possessed sheep and cattle and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the Philistines stopped up all the wells that the servants of his father had dug in the days of Abraham his father. They filled them with earth.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go <transChange type="added">away</transChange> from us, for you have become much too powerful for us."</verse>
    <verse num="17">So Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham. And he gave<note>Or "called"</note> to them {the same names}<note>Literally "names as names"</note> which his father had given<note>Or "called"</note> them.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And when the servants of Isaac dug in the valley, they found a well of fresh water there.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, "The water is ours." And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And they dug another well, and they quarreled over it also. And he called its name Sitnah.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. And he called its name Rehoboth, and said, "Now Yahweh has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."</verse>
    <verse num="23">And from there he went up to Beersheba.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Yahweh appeared to him that night and said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> with you, and I will bless you and make your descendants numerous for the sake of my servant Abraham."</verse>
    <verse num="25">And he built an altar there and called on the name of Yahweh. And he pitched his tent there, and the servants of Isaac dug a well there.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol his army commander.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me? You hate me and sent me away from you."</verse>
    <verse num="28">And they said, "We see clearly that Yahweh has been with you, so we thought<note>Or "said"</note> let there be an oath between us--between us and you--and let us {make}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant with you</verse>
    <verse num="29">that you may not do us harm just as we have not touched you, but have only done good to you and sent you away in peace. You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> now blessed by Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="30">So he made a meal for them, and they ate and drank.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And they arose early in the morning and each one swore to the other,<note>Or "to his brother"</note> and Isaac sent them away. And they left him in peace.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> on that same day the servants of Isaac came and told him about the well that they had dug. And they said, "We have found water!"</verse>
    <verse num="33">And he called it Sheba. Therefore the name of the city <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Beersheba unto this day. </verse>
    <verse num="34">And <transChange type="added">when</transChange> Esau was forty years old he took as wife Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And {they made life bitter}<note>Literally "they caused bitterness of spirit"</note> for Isaac and Rebekah. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="27">
    <verse num="1">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when Isaac <transChange type="added">was</transChange> old and {his eyesight was weak},<note>Literally "his eyes were weak from seeing"</note> he called Esau his older son and said to him, "My son." And he<note>That is, Esau</note> said to him, "Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he said, "Look, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> old; I do not know the day of my death.</verse>
    <verse num="3">So now, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt food for me.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then make for me tasty food like I love, and bring <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to me. And I will eat <transChange type="added">it</transChange> so that I<note>Or "my soul"</note> can bless you before I die. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Now Rebekah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> listening as Isaac spoke to Esau his son, and <transChange type="added">when</transChange> Esau went to the field to hunt wild game to bring <transChange type="added">back</transChange>,</verse>
    <verse num="6">Rebekah said to Jacob her son, "Look, I heard your father speaking to Esau your brother saying,</verse>
    <verse num="7">'Bring wild game to me and prepare tasty food so I can eat <transChange type="added">it</transChange> and bless you before Yahweh before my death.'</verse>
    <verse num="8">So now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I command you.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Go to the flock and take two good young goats from it for me, and I will prepare them <transChange type="added">as</transChange> tasty food for your father, just as he likes.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then you must take it to your father and he will eat <transChange type="added">it</transChange> so that he may bless you before his death."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Jacob said to his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a hairy man, but I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> a smooth man.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Perhaps my father will feel me and I will be in his eyes <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a mocker, and he will bring upon me a curse and not a blessing."</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then his mother said to him, "Your curse be upon me, my son, only listen to my voice--go and get <transChange type="added">them</transChange> for me."</verse>
    <verse num="14">So he went and took <transChange type="added">them</transChange>, and brought <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to his mother, and his mother prepared tasty food as his father liked.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Rebekah took <transChange type="added">some of</transChange> her older son Esau's best garments that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with her in the house, and she put <transChange type="added">them</transChange> on Jacob her younger son.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And she put the skins of the young goats over his hands and over the smooth <transChange type="added">part of</transChange> his neck.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And she put the tasty food and the bread that she had made into the hand of Jacob, her son.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he went to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>. Who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you, my son?"</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Jacob said to his father, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please get up, sit up and eat from my wild game so that you<note>Or "your soul"</note> may bless me."</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Isaac said to his son, "{How}<note>Literally "what is this?"</note> did you find <transChange type="added">it</transChange> so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Because Yahweh your God {caused me to find it}."<note>Literally "made it to happen before me"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please, come near and let me feel you, my son. {Are you really}<note>Literally "are you this one?"</note> my son Esau or not?"</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Jacob drew near to Isaac his father. And he felt him and said, "The voice <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the voice of Jacob, but the hands <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the hands of Esau."</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother. And he blessed him.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And he said, "{Are you really}<note>Literally "are you this one?"</note> my son Esau?" And he said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then he said, "Bring <transChange type="added">it</transChange> near to me that I may eat from the game of my son, so that I<note>Or "my soul"</note> may bless you." And he brought <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to him, and he ate. And he brought wine to him, and he drank.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come near and kiss me, my son."</verse>
    <verse num="27">And he drew near and kissed him. And he<note>That is, Isaac</note> smelled the smell of his garments, and he blessed him and said, </verse>
    <verse num="28">May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of grain and new wine.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you; Be lord of your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. Cursed be those cursing you, and blessed be those blessing you."</verse>
    <verse num="30">And as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, {immediately after}<note>Literally "it was only"</note> Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came <transChange type="added">back</transChange> from his hunting.</verse>
    <verse num="31">He too prepared tasty food and brought <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to his father. And he said to his father, "Let my father arise and eat from the wild game of his son, that you<note>Or "your soul"</note> may bless me."</verse>
    <verse num="32">And Isaac his father said to him, "Who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you?" And he said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> your son, your firstborn, Esau."</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then Isaac {trembled violently}.<note>Literally "trembled a great trembling unto exceeding"</note> Then he said, "Who then <transChange type="added">was</transChange> he that hunted wild game and brought <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to me, and I ate <transChange type="added">it</transChange> all before you came, and I blessed him? Moreover, he will be blessed!"</verse>
    <verse num="34">When Esau heard the words of his father he cried out <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a great and exceedingly bitter cry of distress. And he said to his father, "Bless me as well, my father!"</verse>
    <verse num="35">And he said, "Your brother came in deceit and took your blessing."</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then he said, "{Isn't that why he is named Jacob}?<note>Literally "that his name is called Jacob?"</note> He has deceived me these two times. He took my birthright and, look, now he has taken my blessing!" Then he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"</verse>
    <verse num="37">Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, "Behold, I have made him lord over you and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and <transChange type="added">with</transChange> grain and wine I have sustained him. Now what can I do for you, my son?"</verse>
    <verse num="38">And Esau said to his father, "Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me also, my father!" And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</verse>
    <verse num="39">Then Isaac his father answered and said to him, </verse>
    <verse num="40">But by your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother. But it shall be <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when free yourself you shall tear off his yoke from your neck.</verse>
    <verse num="41">Then Esau held a grudge against Jacob on account of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart,<note>That is, "to himself"</note> "The days of mourning for my father are coming, then I will kill Jacob my brother."</verse>
    <verse num="42">But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called for her younger son Jacob. And she said to him, "Look, Esau your brother <transChange type="added">is</transChange> consoling himself concerning you, <transChange type="added">intending</transChange> to kill you.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Now then, my son, listen to my voice; arise and flee to Haran to Laban my brother.</verse>
    <verse num="44">Stay with him a few days until the wrath of your brother has turned--</verse>
    <verse num="45">until the anger of your brother turns from you and he has forgotten what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I lose the two of you in one day?"</verse>
    <verse num="46">Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I loathe my life because of the Hittite women.<note>Or "daughters of the Hittites"</note> If Jacob takes a wife from Hittite women<note>Or "daughters of the Hittites"</note> like these, from the {native women},<note>Literally "daughters of the land"</note> {what am I living for}?"<note>Literally "What is life to me?"</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="28">
    <verse num="1">Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him. And he instructed him and said to him, "You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.</verse>

    <verse num="5">Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-Aram, to take for himself a wife from there, and<note>Or "when"</note> he blessed him and instructed him, saying, "You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,"</verse>

    <verse num="10">Then Jacob went out from Beersheba and went to Haran.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he arrived at a <transChange type="added">certain</transChange> place and spent the night there, because the sun had set.

    <verse num="12">And he dreamed, and behold, a stairway was set on the earth, and its top touched the heavens. And behold, angels of God <transChange type="added">were</transChange> going up and going down on it.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And behold, Yahweh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> standing beside him,<note>Or "above it"</note> and he said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac.

    <verse num="27">Complete the week of this one,<note>Leah; the wedding feast would last one week</note> then I will also give you the other, {on the condition that you will work for me}<note>Literally "with respect to the work that you will work with me yet"</note> another seven years."</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Jacob did so. So he completed the week of this <transChange type="added">one</transChange>,<note>That is, Leah</note> then he gave Rachel his daughter to him as a wife.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Laban gave Bilhah his female servant to Rachel his daughter as a female servant.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then he also went in to Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with him yet another seven years. </verse>
    <verse num="31">When Yahweh saw that Leah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> unloved he opened her womb, but Rachel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> barren.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, "Because Yahweh has noticed my misery, that I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> unloved. Now my husband will love me."</verse>
    <verse num="33">And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. And she said, "<transChange type="added">It is</transChange> because Yahweh has heard that I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> unloved that he gave me this <transChange type="added">son</transChange> also." And she called his name Simeon.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. Then she said, "Now this time my husband will be joined to me, for I have borne him three sons." Therefore, she called his name Levi.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. And she said, "This time I will praise Yahweh." Therefore she called his name Judah. And she ceased bearing children. </verse>

  <chapter num="30">
    <verse num="1">When Rachel saw that she could not bear children to Jacob, Rachel envied her sister. And she said to Jacob, "Give me children--if not, I will die!"</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Jacob {became angry}<note>Literally "became hot of nose"</note> with Rachel. And he said, "<transChange type="added">Am</transChange> I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then she said, "Here <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my servant girl Bilhah; go in to her that she may bear children {as my surrogate}.<note>Literally "upon my knees"</note> Then I will even {have children}<note>Literally "be built up"</note> by her."</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then she gave him Bilhah, her female servant, as a wife, and Jacob went in to her</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a son for Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Rachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son." Therefore she called his name Dan.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Bilhah, Rachel's servant, conceived again and bore a second son to Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Rachel said, "I have struggled a mighty struggle with my sister and have prevailed." And she called his name Naphtali.</verse>
    <verse num="9">When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took Zilpah her female servant and gave her to Jacob as a wife.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Zilpah, the female slave of Leah, bore a son to Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Leah said, "Good fortune!" And she called his name Gad.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Zilpah, Leah's female servant, bore a second son to Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Leah said, "How happy <transChange type="added">am</transChange> I! For women have called me happy." So she called his name Asher. </verse>
    <verse num="14">And in the days of the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and he brought them to Leah his mother. And Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."</verse>
    <verse num="15">And she said to her, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> your taking my husband <transChange type="added">such</transChange> a small <transChange type="added">thing</transChange> that you will also take the mandrakes of my son?" Then Rachel said, "Then he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."</verse>
    <verse num="16">When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him. And she said, "Come in to me, for {I have hired}<note>Literally "I have fully paid for"</note> you with my son's mandrakes." And he slept with her that night.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And God listened to Leah and she conceived and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Leah said, "God has given <transChange type="added">me</transChange> my wage since I gave my servant girl to my husband." And she called his name Issachar.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good gift. This time my husband will acknowledge me, because I bore him six sons." And she called his name Zebulun.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And afterward she gave birth to a daughter. And she called her name Dinah.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then God remembered Rachel and listened to her, and God opened her womb.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And she conceived and gave birth to a son. And she said, "God has taken away my disgrace."</verse>
    <verse num="24">And she called his name Joseph, saying, "Yahweh has added to me another son." </verse>
    <verse num="25">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> as soon as Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away that I may go to my place and my land.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Give <transChange type="added">me</transChange> my wives and my children for which I have served you, and let me go. For you yourself know my service that I have rendered to you."</verse>
    <verse num="27">But Laban said to him, "Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, I have learned by divination that Yahweh has blessed me because of you."</verse>
    <verse num="28">And he said, "Name your wage to me and I will give <transChange type="added">it</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then he said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you and how your livestock have been with me.<note>I.e., "How well they have done under my care"</note></verse>
    <verse num="30">For you had little before me, and it has increased abundantly. And Yahweh has blessed you {wherever I turned}.<note>Literally "to my foot"</note> So then, when shall I provide for my own family also?"</verse>
    <verse num="31">And he said, "What shall I give you?" And Jacob said, "Do not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flocks and keep <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Let me pass through all your flocks today, removing all the speckled and spotted sheep from them, along with<note>Or "and"</note> every dark-colored sheep among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. That<note>Or "it"</note> shall be my wages.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And my righteousness will answer for me {later}<note>Literally "on the day tomorrow"</note> when you come concerning my wages before you. Every <transChange type="added">one</transChange> that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not speckled or spotted among the goats, or dark-colored among the sheep shall be stolen <transChange type="added">if it is</transChange> with me."</verse>
    <verse num="34">Then Laban said, "Look! Very well. It shall be according to your word."</verse>
    <verse num="35">But that day he<note>That is, Laban</note> removed the streaked and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, all that <transChange type="added">had</transChange> white on it, and every dark-colored ram, and {put them in the charge of his sons}.<note>Literally "he gave into the hands of his sons"</note></verse>
    <verse num="36">And he put a journey of three days between him and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the remainder of Laban's flock.</verse>
    <verse num="37">Then Jacob took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled white strips on them, exposing the white which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on the branches.</verse>
    <verse num="38">And he set the branches that he had peeled in front of the flocks, in the troughs <transChange type="added">and</transChange> in the water containers. And they were in heat when they came to drink.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And the flocks mated by the branches, so the flocks bore streaked, speckled, and spotted.</verse>
    <verse num="40">And Jacob separated the lambs and turned the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark-colored in Laban's flocks. And he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with the flocks of Laban.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And whenever any of the stronger of the flocks were in heat, Jacob put the branches {in full view}<note>Literally "before the eyes of"</note> of the flock in the troughs that they might mate among the branches.</verse>
    <verse num="42">But with the more feeble of the flock he would not put <transChange type="added">them there</transChange>. So the feebler were Laban's and the stronger <transChange type="added">were</transChange> Jacob's.</verse>
    <verse num="43">And the man became {exceedingly}<note>Literally "very, very"</note> rich and had large flocks, female slaves, male slaves, camels, and donkeys. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="31">
    <verse num="1">Now he<note>That is, Jacob</note> heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying, "Jacob has taken all that our father has," and "From that which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> our father's he has gained all this wealth."</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then Jacob saw the face of Laban and, behold, {it was not like it had been in the past}.<note>Literally "there was not with him like yesterday or the day before"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">And Yahweh said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> and to your family, and I will be with you."</verse>
    <verse num="4">So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flocks,</verse>
    <verse num="5">and he said to them, "Look, I see the face of your father, that {it is not like it has been toward me in the past}.<note>Literally "it is not to me like yesterday or the day before"</note> But the God of my father is with me.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now you yourselves know that I have served your father with all my strength,</verse>
    <verse num="7">and your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God has not allowed him to harm me.</verse>
    <verse num="8">If thus he said, 'Speckled shall be your wage,' then all the flock bore speckled. And <transChange type="added">if</transChange> he said, 'Streaked shall be your wage,' then all the flock bore streaked.</verse>
    <verse num="9">God has taken away your father's livestock and given <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to me.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> at the time of the mating of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams mounting the flock <transChange type="added">were</transChange> streaked, speckled, and dappled.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>.'</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said, 'Lift up your eyes and see--all the rams mounting the flock <transChange type="added">are</transChange> streaked, speckled, and dappled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> the God of Bethel where you anointed a stone pillar, where you made a vow to me. Now get up, go out from this land and return to the land of your birth.'"</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, "<transChange type="added">Is there</transChange> yet a portion for us, and an inheritance in the house of our father?</verse>
    <verse num="15">Are we not regarded <transChange type="added">as</transChange> foreigners by him, because he has sold us and completely consumed our money?</verse>
    <verse num="16">For all the wealth that God has taken away from our father, it belongs to us and to our sons. So now, all that God has said to you, do."</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Jacob got up and put his children and his wives on the camels.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he drove all his livestock and his possessions that he had acquired, the livestock of his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-Aram, in order to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the idols<note>Hebrew teraphim</note> that belonged to her father.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Jacob {tricked}<note>Literally "stole the heart of"</note> Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he <transChange type="added">intended to</transChange> flee.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then he fled with all that he had, and arose and crossed the Euphrates<note>Or "the river"</note> and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And on the third day it was told to Laban that Jacob had fled.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued after him, a seven-day journey, and he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, "{Take care}<note>Literally "watch to yourself"</note> that you not speak with Jacob, whether good or evil."</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban and his kinsmen pitched <transChange type="added">their tents</transChange> in the hill country of Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done that you {tricked me}<note>Literally "stole my heart"</note> and have carried off my daughters like captives of the sword?</verse>
    <verse num="27">Why did you hide <transChange type="added">your intention</transChange> to flee and {trick me},<note>Literally "steal my heart"</note> and did not tell me so that I would have sent you away with joy and song and tambourine and lyre?</verse>
    <verse num="28">And <transChange type="added">why</transChange> did you not give me opportunity to kiss my grandsons<note>Or "sons"</note> and my daughters <transChange type="added">goodbye</transChange>? Now you have behaved foolishly <transChange type="added">by</transChange> doing <transChange type="added">this</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="29">{It is in my power}<note>Literally "there is power in my hand"</note> to do harm to you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night saying, '{Take care}<note>Literally "watch to yourself"</note> from speaking with Jacob, whether good or evil.'</verse>
    <verse num="30">Now, you have surely gone because you desperately longed for the house of your father, <transChange type="added">but</transChange> why did you steal my gods?"</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, "Because I <transChange type="added">was</transChange> afraid, for I thought, 'Lest you take your daughters from me by force.'</verse>
    <verse num="32"><transChange type="added">But</transChange> with whomever you find your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of your kinsmen <transChange type="added">now</transChange> identify what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with me <transChange type="added">that is</transChange> yours and take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then Laban went into Jacob's tent and Leah's tent and the tent of the two female servants and did not find <transChange type="added">his gods</transChange>. And he came out of Leah's tent and went into Rachel's tent.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them in the saddle bag of the camel and sat on them. And Jacob searched the whole tent thoroughly but did not find them.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And she said to her father, "Let there not be anger in the eyes of my lord, for I am not able to rise before you, for the way of women <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with me. And he searched carefully and did not find the idols.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then Jacob became angry and quarreled with Laban. Jacob answered and said to Laban, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my offense? What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my sin that you pursued after me?</verse>
    <verse num="37">For you have searched all my possessions and what did you find among all the possessions of my household? Set it before my kinsmen and your kinsmen that they may decide between the two of us!</verse>
    <verse num="38">These twenty years I <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with you; your ewes and your female goats did not miscarry, and the rams of your flocks I did not eat.</verse>
    <verse num="39">I brought no mangled carcass to you--I bore its loss. From my hand you sought it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</verse>
    <verse num="40"><transChange type="added">There</transChange> I was, during the day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="41">These twenty years <transChange type="added">I have been</transChange> in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.</verse>
    <verse num="42">If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac had not been with me, indeed now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my misery and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night."</verse>
    <verse num="43">Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters <transChange type="added">are</transChange> my daughters and the grandsons<note>Or "sons"</note> <transChange type="added">are</transChange> my grandsons,<note>Or "sons"</note> and the flocks <transChange type="added">are</transChange> my flocks, and all that you see, it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> mine. Now, what can I do for these my daughters today, or for their children whom they have borne?</verse>
    <verse num="44">So now, come, let us {make}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between me and you."</verse>
    <verse num="45">And Jacob took a stone and set it up <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a stone pillar.</verse>
    <verse num="46">And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." And they took stones and made a pile of stones, and they ate there by the pile of stones.</verse>
    <verse num="47">And Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha,<note>Aramaic for "the heap of witness"</note> but Jacob called it Galeed.<note>Hebrew for "the heap of witness"</note></verse>
    <verse num="48">Then Laban said, "This pile of stones <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a witness between me and you today." Therefore its name is called Galeed,<note>Hebrew for "the heap of witness"</note></verse>
    <verse num="49">and Mizpah,<note>Hebrew for "watchpost"</note> because he said, "Yahweh watch between me and you when {we are out of sight of each other}.<note>Literally "each from his neighbor is concealed"</note></verse>
    <verse num="50">If you mistreat my daughters, and if you take wives besides my daughters, <transChange type="added">when</transChange> there is no man with us, see--God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a witness between me and you."</verse>
    <verse num="51">And Laban said to Jacob, "See, this pile of stones, and see the pillar that I have set up between me and you.</verse>
    <verse num="52">This pile of stones <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a witness, and the pillar <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a witness, that I will not pass beyond this pile of stones to you, and that you will not pass beyond this pile of stones and this pillar to me intending harm.</verse>
    <verse num="53">May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father<note>That is, Terah</note> judge between us." Then Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.</verse>
    <verse num="54">And Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice on the hill, and he called his kinsmen to eat the meal.<note>Or "food, bread"</note> And they ate the meal<note>Or "food, bread"</note> and spent the night on the hill.</verse>
    <verse num="55"><note>Genesis 31:55-32:32 in the English Bible is 32:1-33 in the Hebrew Bible</note> And Laban arose early in the morning and kissed his grandsons<note>Or "sons"</note> and his daughters, and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his homeland. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="32">
    <verse num="1">And Jacob went on his way, and angels of God met him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And when he saw them, Jacob said, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the camp of God!" And he called the name of that place Mahanaim. </verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the territory of Edom.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he instructed them, saying, "Thus you must say to my lord, to Esau, 'Thus says your servant Jacob, I have dwelled as an alien with Laban, and I have remained <transChange type="added">there</transChange> until now.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And I have acquired cattle, male donkeys, flocks, and male and female slaves, and I have sent to tell my lord, to find favor in your eyes.'"</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the messengers returned to Jacob <transChange type="added">and</transChange> said, "We came to your brother, to Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men <transChange type="added">are</transChange> with him."</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Jacob was very frightened and distressed. So he divided the people, flocks, cattle, and camels that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him into two companies.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he thought, "If Esau comes to one company and destroys it, the remaining company will be <transChange type="added">able</transChange> to escape."</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Yahweh, who said to me, 'Return to your land and to your family, and I will deal well with you.'</verse>
    <verse num="10">{I am not worthy}<note>Literally "I am small"</note> of all the loyal love and all the faithfulness that you have shown<note>Or "done"</note> your servant, for with <transChange type="added">only</transChange> my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Please rescue me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and attack mother and children <transChange type="added">alike</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now you yourself said, 'I will surely deal well with you and make your offspring as the sand of the sea that cannot be counted for abundance.'" </verse>
    <verse num="13">And he lodged there that night. Then he took {from what he had with him}<note>Literally "from that which was going from his hand"</note> a gift for Esau his brother:</verse>
    <verse num="14">two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, twenty rams,</verse>
    <verse num="15">thirty milk camels with their young, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten male donkeys.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he put <transChange type="added">them</transChange> under the hand of his servants, {herd by herd},<note>Literally "every herd by its own"</note> and said to his servants, "Cross on ahead before me, and put some distance {between herds}.<note>Literally "between a herd and between a herd"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">And he instructed the foremost, saying, "When Esau my brother comes upon you and asks you, saying, 'Whose <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you and where are you going? To whom do these <transChange type="added">animals</transChange> belong ahead of you?'</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then you must say, 'To your servant, to Jacob. It <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. Now behold, he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> also <transChange type="added">coming</transChange> after us.'"</verse>
    <verse num="19">And he also instructed the second <transChange type="added">servant</transChange> and the third, and everyone <transChange type="added">else</transChange> who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> behind the herds, saying, "You must speak to Esau according to this word when you find him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And moreover, you shall say, 'Look, your servant Jacob <transChange type="added">is</transChange> behind us.'" For he thought, "{Let me appease him}<note>Literally "let me cover his face"</note> with the gift going before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will {show me favor}."<note>Literally "lift up my face"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">So the gift passed on before him, but he himself spent that night in the camp. </verse>
    <verse num="22">That night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he took them and sent them across the stream. Then he sent across all his possessions.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Jacob remained alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the dawn.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And when he<note>That is, the man</note> saw that he could not prevail against him, he struck his hip socket, so that Jacob's hip socket was sprained as he wrestled with him.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then he<note>That is, the man</note> said, "Let me go, for dawn is breaking." But he answered, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then he said to him, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your name?" And he said, "Jacob."</verse>
    <verse num="28">And he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel,<note>"Israel" means "he struggles with God," or "God struggles"</note> for you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed."</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then Jacob asked and said, "Please tell me your name." And he said, "Why do you ask this--for my name?" And he blessed him there.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then Jacob called the name of the place Peniel <transChange type="added">which means</transChange> "I have seen God face to face and my life was spared."</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then the sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Therefore the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> do not eat the sinew of the sciatic nerve that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> upon the socket of the hip unto this day, because he struck the socket of the thigh of Jacob at the sinew of the sciatic nerve. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="33">
    <verse num="1">And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked.

And he<note>That is, Jacob</note> divided the children among Leah and among Rachel, and among the two of his female servants.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he put the female slaves and their children first, then Leah and her children next, then Rachel with Joseph last.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he himself passed on before them and bowed down to the ground seven times until he came to his brother.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell upon his neck and kissed him, and they wept.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, "Who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> these with you?" And he said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the female servants drew near, they and their children, and they bowed down.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Leah and her children drew near and bowed down, and afterward Joseph and Rachel drew near and they bowed down.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he<note>That is, Esau</note> said, "{What do you mean by}<note>Literally "What to you?"</note> all this company that I have met?" Then he said, "To find favor in the eyes of my lord."</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Esau said, "{I have enough}<note>Literally "There is to me abundance"</note> my brother; {keep what you have}."<note>Literally "let what is to you be to you"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">And Jacob said, "No, please, if I have found favor in your eyes, you must take my gift from my hand, for then I have seen your face <transChange type="added">which is</transChange> like seeing the face of God, and you have received me.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Please take my gift which has been brought to you, for God has dealt graciously with me, and because {I have enough}."<note>Literally "There is to me abundance"</note> And he urged him, so he took <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then he<note>That is, Esau</note> said, "Let us journey and go <transChange type="added">on</transChange>, and I will go ahead of you."</verse>
    <verse num="13">But he said to him, "My lord knows that the children <transChange type="added">are</transChange> frail, and the flocks and the cattle <transChange type="added">which are</transChange> nursing <transChange type="added">are a concern</transChange> to me. Now <transChange type="added">if</transChange> they drove them hard for a day all the flocks would die.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Let my lord pass on before his servant and I will move along slowly at the pace<note>Or "foot"</note> of the livestock that are ahead of me, and at the pace<note>Or "foot"</note> of the children until I come to my lord in Seir."</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Esau said, "Let me leave some of my people with you." But he said, "{What need is there}?<note>Literally "What is this?"</note> Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."</verse>
    <verse num="16">So Esau turned that day on his way to Seir.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But Jacob traveled on to Succoth, and he built for himself a house, and he made shelters for his livestock. Therefore he called the name of the place Succoth.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the land of Canaan, {on his way}<note>Literally "at his coming"</note> from Paddan-Aram. And he camped before the city.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And he bought a piece of land where he pitched his tent for one hundred pieces of money<note>Hebrew kesitah</note> from the hand of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem.</verse>

  <chapter num="34">
    <verse num="1">Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. And he took her and lay with her and raped her.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And his soul clung to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke {tenderly}<note>Literally "to the heart"</note> to the girl.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So Shechem said to Hamor his father, saying, "Get this girl for me as a wife." </verse>
    <verse num="5">And Jacob heard that Dinah his daughter had been defiled, but his sons were with his flocks in the field. And Jacob kept silent until they came.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Hamor, father of Shechem, went out to Jacob to speak with him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard <transChange type="added">it</transChange>. And the men were distressed and very angry because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by having sexual relations with the daughter of Jacob--{something that}<note>Literally "and thus"</note> should not be done.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Hamor spoke with them saying, "Shechem my son {is in love with}<note>Literally "his soul longs for"</note> your daughter. Please give her to him for a wife.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Make marriages with us. Give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.</verse>
    <verse num="10">You shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you; settle and trade in it, and acquire <transChange type="added">property</transChange> in it."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will do.</verse>
    <verse num="12">{Make the bride price and gift as high as you like};<note>Literally "Increase upon me very bride price and gift"</note> I will give what you say to me. But give me the girl as a wife."</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor speaking deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> uncircumcised, for that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a disgrace for us.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Only on this <transChange type="added">condition</transChange> will we give consent to you; if you will become like us--every male among you to be circumcised.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take for ourselves your daughters, and we will live with you and become one family.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our daughters and we will go."</verse>
    <verse num="18">And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shechem, the son of Hamor.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the young man did not delay to do the thing, for he wanted the daughter of Jacob. Now he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the most honored of his father's house.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city, and they spoke to the men of their city, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="21">"These men <transChange type="added">are</transChange> at peace with us. Let them dwell in the land and let them trade in it. Now, behold, the land is {broad enough for them}.<note>Literally "broad on sides before them"</note> Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give our daughters to them.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Only on this <transChange type="added">condition</transChange> will they give consent to us, to live with us <transChange type="added">and</transChange> to become one family--when every male among us <transChange type="added">is</transChange> circumcised as they are circumcised.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals <transChange type="added">be</transChange> ours? Only let us give consent to them so they will live among us."</verse>
    <verse num="24">And all those who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and Shechem. Every male was circumcised, all those who went out of the gate of his city.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> on the third day, while they were in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, each took his sword and came against the unsuspecting city and killed all the males.</verse>
    <verse num="26">They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and they took Dinah from the house of Shechem and went out.</verse>
    <verse num="27">The <transChange type="added">other</transChange> sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.</verse>
    <verse num="28">They took their flocks and their cattle and their donkeys, and whatever <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the field.</verse>
    <verse num="29">They captured and plundered all that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the houses--all their wealth, their little ones, and their women.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me, making me stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites! I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> few in number! If they gather against me and attack me, I will be destroyed--I and my household!"</verse>
    <verse num="31">But they said, "Shall he treat our sister like a prostitute?" </verse>

  <chapter num="35">
    <verse num="1">And God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there, and make an altar to the God who appeared to you when you fled from before Esau your brother."</verse>

    <verse num="4">So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in their hands, and the ornamental rings that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in their ears.

    <verse num="5">Then they set out on their journey, and the terror of God was upon the cities that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> all around them, so that they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</verse>

And they<note>That is, the brothers</note> drew Joseph up and brought <transChange type="added">him</transChange> up from the pit, and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty <transChange type="added">pieces of</transChange> silver. And they brought Joseph to Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then Reuben returned to the pit and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit. And he tore his clothes.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And he returned to his brothers and said, "The boy {is gone}!<note>Literally "is not"</note> Now I, {what can I do}?"<note>Literally "where am I going?"</note></verse>
    <verse num="31">Then they took the robe of Joseph and slaughtered a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then they sent the robe with long sleeves<note>Or "of many colors"</note> and they brought <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to their father and said, "We found this; please examine <transChange type="added">it</transChange>. <transChange type="added">Is</transChange> it the robe of your son or not?"</verse>
    <verse num="33">And he recognized it and said, "The robe of my son! A wild animal has devoured him! Joseph <transChange type="added">is</transChange> surely torn to pieces!"</verse>
    <verse num="34">And Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And all his sons and daughters tried to console him, but he refused to be consoled. And he said, "No, I shall go down to my son, to Sheol, mourning." And his father wept for him.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, a commander of the imperial guard. </verse>

  <chapter num="38">
    <verse num="1">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> at that time Judah went down from his brothers and pitched his tent near a certain Adullamite, whose name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Hirah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite there whose name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Shua. And he took her and went in to her.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And she conceived again and bore a son, and he called his name Onan.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And once again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. And he<note>That is, Judah</note> was in Chezib when she bore him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Tamar.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh killed him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to the wife of your brother and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."</verse>
    <verse num="9">But Onan knew that the offspring would not be for him, so whenever he went in to the wife of his brother he would waste <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on the ground<note>Meaning he would spill his semen on the ground</note> so as not to give offspring to his brother.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And what he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, so he killed him also.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Stay a widow in your father's house until Shelah my son grows up," for {he feared he would also die}<note>Literally "he thought lest he also will die"</note> like his brother. So Tamar went and stayed in the house of her father.</verse>
    <verse num="12">{And in the course of time}<note>Literally "And the days increased"</note> the daughter of Shua, the wife of Judah, died. When Judah was consoled he went up to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite, to Timnah.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it was told to Tamar, saying, "Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."</verse>
    <verse num="14">So she removed the clothes of her widowhood and covered <transChange type="added">herself</transChange> with the veil and disguised herself. And she sat at the entrance to Eynayim, which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on the way to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah was grown but she had not been given to him as a wife.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Judah saw her and reckoned her to <transChange type="added">be</transChange> a prostitute, for she had covered her face.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he turned aside to her at the roadside and said, "Please come, let me come in to you," for he did not know that she <transChange type="added">was</transChange> his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give to me that you may come in to me?"</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he said, "I will send a kid from the goats of the flock." And she said, "<transChange type="added">Only</transChange> if you give a pledge until you send <transChange type="added">it</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he said, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the pledge that I must give to you?" And she said, "your seal, your cord, and your staff that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in your hand." And he gave <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to her and went in to her. And she conceived by him.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And she arose and left, and she removed her veil from herself and put on the garments of her widowhood.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Judah sent the kid from the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to take <transChange type="added">back</transChange> the pledge from the hand of the woman, but he could not find her.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So he asked the men of her place, saying, "Where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> that cult prostitute <transChange type="added">that was</transChange> at Eynayim by the roadside?" And they said, "There is no cult prostitute here."</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then he returned to Judah and said, "I could not find her. Morever, the men of the place said, 'There is no cult prostitute here.'"</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Judah said, "Let her take <transChange type="added">them</transChange> for herself, lest we be {laughed at}.<note>Literally "as contempt"</note> Behold, I sent this kid, but you could not find her."</verse>
    <verse num="24">And {about three months later}<note>Literally "it happened about three months"</note> it was told to Judah, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the whore, and now, behold, she has conceived by prostitution." And Judah said, "Bring her out and let her be burned."</verse>
    <verse num="25">She was brought out, but she sent to her father-in-law saying, "By the man to whom these <transChange type="added">belong</transChange> I have conceived." And she said, "Now discern<note>Or "examine"</note> to whom these <transChange type="added">belong</transChange>: the seal and cord and the staff."</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then Judah recognized <transChange type="added">them</transChange> and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not know<note>"Know" is a euphemism for "have sexual relations with"</note> her again.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> at the time she gave birth that, behold, twins <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in her womb.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> at her labor one <transChange type="added">child</transChange> put out a hand. And the midwife took <transChange type="added">it</transChange> and tied a crimson thread on his hand saying, "This <transChange type="added">one</transChange> came out first."</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then his hand drew back and, behold, his brother came out, and she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" And she called his name Perez.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And afterward his brother who <transChange type="added">had</transChange> the crimson thread on his hand came out. And his name was called Zerah. </verse>

    <verse num="1">Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, commander of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.</verse>

    <verse num="13">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when she saw that he left his garment in her hand and fled outside,</verse>
    <verse num="14">she called to the men of her house and said to them, "Look! He<note>That is, Potiphar</note> brought a Hebrew man to us to mock us! He came to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.</verse>

    <verse num="1">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> after these things the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and <transChange type="added">his</transChange> baker did wrong against their lord, against the king of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, with the chief cupbearer and chief baker.</verse>

    <verse num="5">And the two of them, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> confined in the prison, dreamed a dream, each his own dream, with its own interpretation.</verse>
    <verse num="6">When Joseph came to them in the morning he looked at them, and behold, they were troubled.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he asked the court officials of Pharaoh that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him in the custody of his master's house, "Why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> your faces sad today?"</verse>

    <verse num="9">Then the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and he said to him, "In my dream, now behold, <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> a vine before me,</verse>
    <verse num="10">and on the vine <transChange type="added">were</transChange> three branches. And as it budded, its blossoms came up, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> its clusters of grapes grew ripe.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the cup of Pharaoh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into the cup of Pharaoh. Then I placed the cup into the hand of Pharaoh."</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Joseph said to him, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> its interpretation: The three branches, they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> three days.</verse>

    <verse num="15">For I was surely kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me in this pit."</verse>
    <verse num="16">And when the chief baker saw that the interpretation <transChange type="added">was</transChange> good he said to Joseph, "I also <transChange type="added">dreamed</transChange>.

    <verse num="1">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> after {two full years}<note>Literally "two years of days"</note> Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he was standing by the Nile.</verse>

    <verse num="5">And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time, and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were coming out of one stalk.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And behold, seven thin ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the thin ears of grain swallowed up the seven plump and full ears of grain. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> a dream.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called all of the magicians<note>Or "soothsayer priests"</note> of Egypt, and all its wise men, and Pharaoh told his dream to them.

    <verse num="13">And it happened just as he interpreted to us, so it was. He<note>That is, Pharaoh</note> restored me to my office, and him<note>That is, the chief baker</note> he<note>That is, Pharaoh</note> hanged."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Pharaoh sent and called <transChange type="added">for</transChange> Joseph, and they brought him quickly from the prison. And he shaved and changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I dreamed a dream, but there is none to interpret it. Now, I have heard concerning you <transChange type="added">that when</transChange> you hear a dream <transChange type="added">you can</transChange> interpret it."</verse>

    <verse num="25">Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh <transChange type="added">are</transChange> one. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</verse>

    <verse num="28">This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the word that I have spoken to Pharaoh; God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the whole land of Egypt.</verse>

    <verse num="33">Now then, let Pharaoh select a man <transChange type="added">who is</transChange> discerning and wise, and let him set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>

    <verse num="42">Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his finger and put it on the finger of Joseph. And he clothed him with garments of fine linen, and he put a chain of gold around his neck.</verse>

    <verse num="54">And the seven years of famine began to come as Joseph had said. And there was famine in all of the countries, but in the land of Egypt there was food.</verse>
    <verse num="55">And when all the land of Egypt was hungry the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. And Pharaoh said to all the land of Egypt, "Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you must do."</verse>
    <verse num="56">And the famine was over the whole land, and Joseph opened all the storehouses<note>Hebrew "that which was in them"</note> and sold <transChange type="added">food</transChange> to the Egyptians. And the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="57">And every land came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, for the famine was severe in every land. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="42">
    <verse num="1">When Jacob realized that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?"</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then he said, "Look, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy grain for us there that we may live and not die."</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But Jacob did not send Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, for {he feared harm would come to him}.<note>Literally "he thought, lest harm encounter him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the sons of Israel went to buy grain amid those <transChange type="added">other people</transChange> who went <transChange type="added">as well</transChange>, for there was famine in the land of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now Joseph was the governor over the land. He <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the one who sold <transChange type="added">food</transChange> to all the people of the land. And the brothers of Joseph came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger to them. And he spoke with them harshly and said to them, "From where have you come?" And they said, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed concerning them, and he said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!"</verse>
    <verse num="10">And they said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.</verse>
    <verse num="11">We all are sons of one man. We <transChange type="added">are</transChange> honest <transChange type="added">men</transChange>. We, your servants, are not spies."</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then he said to them, "No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land."</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then they said, "We, your servants, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, but behold, the youngest <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with our father today, and one is no more."</verse>
    <verse num="14">But Joseph said to them, "It <transChange type="added">is</transChange> what I said to you--you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> spies.</verse>
    <verse num="15">By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh you will not go out from here unless your youngest brother comes here.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, but you will be kept in prison so that your words might be tested <transChange type="added">to see</transChange> if <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> truth with you. And if not, by the life of Pharaoh surely you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> spies."</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then he gathered them into the prison for three days.</verse>
    <verse num="18">On the third day Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live; I fear God.</verse>
    <verse num="19">If you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> honest, let one of your brothers be kept in prison {where you are now being kept},<note>Literally "in the house of your custody"</note> but <transChange type="added">the rest of</transChange> you go, carry grain for the famine for your households.</verse>
    <verse num="20">You must bring your youngest brother to me, and then your words will be confirmed and you will not die." And they did so.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then each said to his brother, "Surely we <transChange type="added">are</transChange> guilty on account of our brother when we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded for mercy to us and we would not listen. Therefore this trouble has come to us."</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then Reuben answered them, saying, "Did I not say to you, do not sin against the boy? But you did not listen, and now, behold, his blood has been sought."</verse>
    <verse num="23">Now they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter <transChange type="added">was</transChange> between them.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And he turned away from them and wept. Then he returned to them and spoke to them, and took Simeon from them and tied him up in front of them.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to return their money to each sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then they loaded their grain upon their donkeys and went <transChange type="added">away</transChange> from there.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And one <transChange type="added">of them later</transChange> opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place and saw his money--behold, it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the mouth of his sack.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And he said to his brothers, "My money was returned and moreover, behold, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> in my sack!" Then {their hearts failed them}<note>Literally "their heart went out"</note> and each of them trembled <transChange type="added">and</transChange> said, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this God has done to us?" </verse>
    <verse num="29">And when they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan they told him everything <transChange type="added">that</transChange> had happened to them, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="30">"The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and treated us as <transChange type="added">if we were</transChange> spying out the land.</verse>
    <verse num="31">But we said to him, 'We <transChange type="added">are</transChange> honest; we are not spies.</verse>
    <verse num="32">We <transChange type="added">are</transChange> twelve brothers, the sons of our father. One is no more and the youngest <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with our father now in the land of Canaan.'</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> honest. Leave one <transChange type="added">brother</transChange> with me, and take <transChange type="added">food for</transChange> the famine in your households and go.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> not spies but you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> honest. And I will give your brother <transChange type="added">back</transChange> to you, and you will trade in the land.'"</verse>
    <verse num="35">And it happened <transChange type="added">that when</transChange> they emptied their sacks, behold, each one's pouch of money <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in his sack. And when they and their father saw the pouches of their money, they were greatly distressed.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And Jacob their father said to them, "You have bereaved me--Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and Benjamin you would take! All of this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> against me!</verse>
    <verse num="37">Then Reuben said to his father, "You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hand and I myself will return him to you."</verse>
    <verse num="38">But he said, "My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone remains. <transChange type="added">If</transChange> harm meets him on the journey that you would take, you would bring down my gray head in sorrow to Sheol." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="43">
    <verse num="1">Now the famine in the land <transChange type="added">was</transChange> severe.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> as they finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt their father said to them, "Return and buy a little food for us."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Judah said to him, "The man solemnly admonished us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with you.'</verse>
    <verse num="4">{If you will send}<note>Literally "if there is a sending"</note> our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you,</verse>
    <verse num="5">but {if you will not send}<note>Literally "if there is no sending"</note> <transChange type="added">him</transChange>, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with you.'"</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Israel said, "Why did you bring trouble to me by telling the man you still had a brother?"</verse>
    <verse num="7">And they said, "The man asked explicitly about us and about our family, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have a brother?' And we answered him according to these words. How could we know that he would say, 'Bring down your brother'?"</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the boy with me, and let us arise and go, so that we will live and not die--you, we, and our children.</verse>
    <verse num="9">I myself will be surety for him. You may seek him from my hand. If I do not bring him back to you and present him before you, then I will stand guilty before you forever.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Surely if we had not hesitated by this <transChange type="added">time</transChange> we would have returned twice."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then their father Israel said to them, "If <transChange type="added">it must be</transChange> so then do this. Take some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift--a little balm and honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, and pistachios and almonds.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And take double <transChange type="added">the</transChange> money in your hands. Take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a mistake.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And take your brother. Now arise and return to the man.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And may El-Shaddai<note>Often translated "God Almighty"</note> grant you compassion before the man that he may release your other brother to you and Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved." </verse>
    <verse num="15">So the men took this gift, and they took double money in their hands, and Benjamin, and they rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.</verse>
    <verse num="16">When Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to the one who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over his household, "Bring the men into the house and slaughter and prepare <transChange type="added">an animal</transChange>, for the men shall eat with me at noon."</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the man did as Joseph had said, and the man brought the men into the house of Joseph.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the men were afraid when they were brought into the house of Joseph. And they said "We were brought <transChange type="added">here</transChange> on account of the money that was returned to our sacks the first time, that he might attack us and fall upon us to take us as slaves with our donkeys."</verse>
    <verse num="19">So they approached the man who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over Joseph's house and spoke to him at the doorway of the house.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And they said, "Please, my lord, we surely came down once before to buy food,</verse>
    <verse num="21">but when we came to the place of lodging and we opened our sacks, then behold, each one's money <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the mouth of his sack--our money in its <transChange type="added">full</transChange> weight--so we have returned <transChange type="added">with</transChange> it in our hands.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Now, other money we have brought down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks."</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he said, "Peace to you; do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father must have given you a treasure in your sacks; your money came to me." And he brought Simeon out to them.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then the man brought the men into Joseph's house and he gave them water and washed their feet, and gave fodder to their donkeys.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then they laid out<note>Or "prepared"</note> the gift until Joseph came at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat food there.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And when Joseph came into the house they brought the gift that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in their hand into the house to him, and they bowed down before him to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And {he greeted them}<note>Literally "he asked peace for them"</note> and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"</verse>
    <verse num="28">And they said, "Your servant our father <transChange type="added">is</transChange> well; he is still alive." And they knelt and bowed down.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then he lifted up his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, and said, "Is this your youngest brother of whom you told me?" And he continued,<note>Or "said"</note> "God be gracious to you, my son."</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then Joseph {hurried away},<note>Literally "made haste"</note> {being overcome with emotion}<note>Literally "his compassion boiled up"</note> toward his brother, and sought for <transChange type="added">a place</transChange> to cry. Then he went into a room and wept there.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then he washed his face and went out, now controlling himself, and said, "Serve the food."</verse>
    <verse num="32">And they served him<note>That is, Joseph</note> by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves, for Egyptians {could not dine}<note>Literally "were not able to eat food"</note> with Hebrews, because that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a detestable thing to Egyptians.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And they were seated before him <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the firstborn according to his birthright <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the youngest according to his youth. And the men {looked at one another}<note>Literally "each to his companion"</note> amazed.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And portions were served to them from {his table},<note>Literally "his presence"</note> and the portion of Benjamin was five times greater than the portion of any of them. And they drank and became drunk with him. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="44">
    <verse num="1">Then he commanded <transChange type="added">the one</transChange> who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over his household, saying, "Fill the sacks of the men <transChange type="added">with</transChange> food as much as they are able to carry, and put each one's money in the mouth of his sack.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And my cup--the cup of silver--you shall put into the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and the money for his grain. And he did according to the word of Joseph that he had commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="3"><transChange type="added">When</transChange> the morning light <transChange type="added">came</transChange> the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.</verse>
    <verse num="4">They went out of the city, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> had not gone far when Joseph said to <transChange type="added">the one</transChange> who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over his house, "Arise! Pursue after the men and overtake them. Then you shall say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?</verse>
    <verse num="5">Is this not that from which my master drinks? Now he himself certainly practices divination with it. You have done evil <transChange type="added">in</transChange> what you have done.'"</verse>
    <verse num="6">When he overtook them he spoke these words to them.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And they said to him, "Why has my lord spoken according to these words? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!</verse>
    <verse num="8">Behold, the money that we found in the mouth of our sacks we returned to you from the land of Canaan. Now why would we steal silver or gold from the house of my lord?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Whoever is found with it from among your servants shall die. And moreover, we will become slaves to my lord."</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then he said, "Now also according to your words, thus will it be. He who is found with it shall be my slave, but you shall be innocent."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then each man quickly brought down his sack to the ground, and each one opened his sack.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he searched, beginning with the oldest and finishing with the youngest. And the cup was found in the sack of Benjamin.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then they tore their clothes, and each one loaded his donkey and they returned to the city. </verse>
    <verse num="14">And Judah and his brothers came to the house of Joseph--now he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> still there--they fell before him to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Joseph said to them, "What is this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like me surely practices divination?"</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Judah said, "What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? Now how can we show ourselves innocent? God has found the guilt of your servants! Behold, we <transChange type="added">are</transChange> slaves to my lord, both we and also he in whose hand the cup was found."</verse>
    <verse num="17">But he said, "Far be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found, he will become my slave. But as for you, go up in peace to your father."</verse>
    <verse num="18">But Judah drew near to him and said, "Please my lord, let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and {let not your anger burn}<note>Literally "let not your nose become hot"</note> against your servant, for {you are like Pharaoh himself}.<note>Literally "like you like Pharaoh"</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">My lord had asked his servants, saying, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'</verse>
    <verse num="20">And we said to my lord, 'We have an aged father, and a younger <transChange type="added">brother</transChange>, the child of his old age, and his brother died, and he alone remains from his mother, and his father loves him.'</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes upon him.'</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then we said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father; if he should leave his father, then he<note>That is, the father (Jacob/Israel)</note> would die.'</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not again see my face.'</verse>
    <verse num="24">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> we went up to your servant, my father, and told him the words of my lord.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And when our father said, 'Buy a little food for us,'</verse>
    <verse num="26">then we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with us, then we shall go down. For we will not be able to see the face of the man unless our youngest brother <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with us.'</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then your servant, my father, said to us, 'You yourselves know that my wife bore two sons to me.</verse>
    <verse num="28">One went out from me, and I said, "Surely he must have been torn to pieces," and I have never seen him since.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And if you take this one also from me, and he encounters harm, you will bring down my gray head in sorrow to Sheol.'</verse>
    <verse num="30">So now, when I come to your servant, my father, and the boy is not with us--now his life is bound up with his life--</verse>
    <verse num="31">it shall happen <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when he sees that the boy is gone, he will die. And your servants will bring down the gray head of your servant, our father, to Sheol with sorrow.</verse>
    <verse num="32">For your servant is pledged as surety for the boy by my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you, then I shall be culpable to my father forever.</verse>
    <verse num="33">So then, please let your servant remain in place of the boy as a slave to my lord, and let the boy go up with his brothers.</verse>
    <verse num="34">For how can I go up to my father if the boy is not with me? {I do not want to see}<note>Literally "lest I see"</note> the misery which will find my father." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="45">
    <verse num="1">Then Joseph was not able to control himself before all who were standing by him. And he cried out, "Make every man go out from me!" So no one stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And {he wept loudly},<note>Literally "he gave his voice with weeping"</note> so that the Egyptians heard <transChange type="added">it</transChange> and the household of Pharaoh heard <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> Joseph! Is my father still alive?" And his brothers were unable to answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please." And they drew near. And he said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="5">So now, do not be distressed and do not be angry {with yourselves}<note>Literally "in your eyes"</note> that you sold me here, for God sent me as deliverance before you.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For these two years the famine <transChange type="added">has been</transChange> in the midst of the land, but <transChange type="added">there will be</transChange> five more years where there is no plowing or harvest.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And God sent me before you <transChange type="added">all</transChange> to preserve for you a remnant in the land and to keep alive among you many survivors.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So now, you yourselves did not send me here, but God put me here as father to Pharaoh and as master of all his household, and a ruler over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Hurry, and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me and do not delay.</verse>
    <verse num="10">You shall settle in the land of Goshen so that you will be near me, you and your children and your grandchildren, and your flocks and your herds and all that you have.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And I will provide for you there, because <transChange type="added">there are</transChange> still five years of famine--lest you and your household and all that you have become destitute.'</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that {it is I}<note>Literally "it is my mouth"</note> who am speaking to you.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And you must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt and all that you have seen. Now hurry and bring my father here."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then he fell upon the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. And afterward his brothers spoke with him.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then the report was heard <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the house of Pharaoh, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come." And it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers: 'Do this--load your donkeys and go back to the land of Canaan,</verse>
    <verse num="18">and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.'</verse>
    <verse num="19">And you <transChange type="added">Joseph</transChange>, are commanded <transChange type="added">to say</transChange> this: 'Do this! Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives, and bring your father and come!</verse>
    <verse num="20">{Do not worry}<note>Literally "let not your eyes be troubled"</note> about your possessions, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'" </verse>
    <verse num="21">And the sons of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons at the word of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.</verse>
    <verse num="22">To each and to all of them he gave sets of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of clothing.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And to his father he sent {as follows}:<note>Literally "according to this"</note> ten donkeys carrying the best of Egypt, and ten donkeys carrying grain and food and provisions for his father for the journey.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then he sent his brothers away, and when they departed he said to them, "Do not be agitated on the journey."</verse>
    <verse num="25">So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And they spoke to him, saying, "Joseph <transChange type="added">is</transChange> still alive, and he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> ruler over all the land of Egypt." And his heart {went numb},<note>Or "became cold"</note> because he did not believe him.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them. And when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, then the spirit of Jacob their father revived.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Israel said, "<transChange type="added">It is</transChange> enough. Joseph my son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> still alive. I will go and see him before I die." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="46">
    <verse num="1">So Israel journeyed with all that he had, and he came to Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then he said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there.</verse>
    <verse num="4">I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I myself will also bring you up. And Joseph will place his hand over your eyes."</verse>
    <verse num="5">So Jacob arose from Beersheba. And the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, and their little ones and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to transport him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And they took their livestock and their possessions that they had acquired in the land of Canaan. And they came to Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him,</verse>
    <verse num="7">his sons and his sons' sons with him, his daughters and his daughters' daughters with him, into Egypt. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Now these <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons. Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob</verse>

    <verse num="10">The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.</verse>

    <verse num="28">He<note>That is, Jacob</note> had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to appear before him<note>That is, Jacob</note> in Goshen. And they came to the land of Goshen.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen. He presented himself to him and fell upon his neck and wept upon his neck a long time.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die since I have seen your face, for you are still alive."</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and report to Pharaoh, and I will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the land of Canaan have come to me.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And the men <transChange type="added">are</transChange> shepherds, for they are men of livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their cattle and all that they have.'</verse>
    <verse num="33">And it shall be <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when Pharaoh calls you he will say, 'What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your occupation?'</verse>
    <verse num="34">Then you must say, 'You servants <transChange type="added">are</transChange> men of livestock from our childhood until now, both we and also our ancestors,'<note>Or "fathers"</note> so that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a detestable thing to Egyptians." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="47">
    <verse num="1">So Joseph went and reported to Pharaoh. And he said, "My father and my brothers, with their flocks and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan. Now <transChange type="added">they are</transChange> here in the land of Goshen."</verse>
    <verse num="2">And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them before Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your occupation?" And they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants <transChange type="added">are</transChange> keepers of sheep, both we and also our ancestors."<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">And they said to Pharaoh, "We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servant's flocks, for the famine <transChange type="added">is</transChange> severe in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.</verse>
    <verse num="6">The land of Egypt <transChange type="added">is</transChange> before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen, and if you know there is among them men of ability, then appoint them overseers of my own livestock."</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, "{How old are you}?"<note>Literally "How many are the days of the years of your life?"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">And Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my sojourning <transChange type="added">are</transChange> one hundred and thirty years. Few and hard have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not reached the days of the years of the lives of my ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> in the days of their sojourning."</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and he went out from the presence of Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them property in the land of Egypt in the best part of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had instructed.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all the household of his father with food, according to the number of their children. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine <transChange type="added">was</transChange> very severe. And the land of Egypt languished, with the land of Canaan, on account of the famine.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Joseph collected all the money found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain that they were buying. And Joseph brought the money into the house of Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when the money was spent in the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, all of Egypt came to Joseph, saying, "Give us food! Why should we die before you? For the money is used up."</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Joseph said, "Give your livestock and I will give you <transChange type="added">food</transChange> in exchange for your livestock if <transChange type="added">your</transChange> money is used up."</verse>
    <verse num="17">So they brought their herds to Joseph, and Joseph gave food to them in exchange for horses, their flocks, and their cattle and donkeys. And he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.</verse>
    <verse num="18">When that year ended, they came to him in the following year and said to him, "We cannot hide from my lord that <transChange type="added">our</transChange> money and livestock belong to my lord. Nothing remains before my lord except our bodies and our land.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Why should we die in front of you, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, then we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Then give us seed and we shall live and not die, and the land will not become desolate."</verse>
    <verse num="20">So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for each Egyptian sold his field, for the famine <transChange type="added">was</transChange> severe upon them. And the land became Pharaoh's.</verse>
    <verse num="21">As for the people, he transferred them to the cities, from one end of the territory of Egypt to the other.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> an allotment for the priests from Pharaoh, and they {lived on}<note>Literally "ate"</note> the allotment that Pharaoh gave to them. Therefore they did not sell their land.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Joseph said to the people, "Look, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Here <transChange type="added">is</transChange> seed for you so you can sow the land.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And it shall happen <transChange type="added">that</transChange> at the harvest, you must give a fifth to Pharaoh and four-fifths shall be yours, as seed for the field and for your food and for those who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in your households, and as food for your little ones."</verse>
    <verse num="25">And they said, "You have saved our lives. <transChange type="added">If</transChange> we have found favor in the eyes of my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh."</verse>
    <verse num="26">So Joseph made it a statute unto this day concerning the land of Egypt: one fifth to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests alone did not belong to Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="27">So Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they acquired possessions in it and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. And the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred and forty-seven years.</verse>
    <verse num="29">When {the time of Israel's death drew near},<note>Literally "the days of Israel drew near to die"</note> he called to his son, to Joseph. And he said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, that you might <transChange type="added">vow</transChange> to deal kindly<note>Or "loyal love"</note> and faithfully with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt,</verse>
    <verse num="30">but let me lie with my ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial site." And he said, "I will do according to your word."</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then he said, "Swear to me." And he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="48">
    <verse num="1">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> after these things, it was said to Joseph, "Behold, your father <transChange type="added">is</transChange> ill." And he took his two sons with him, Ephraim and Manasseh.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And it was told to Jacob, "Behold, your son Joseph has come to you." Then Israel strengthened himself and he sat up in the bed.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Jacob said to Joseph, "El-Shaddai<note>Often translated "God Almighty"</note> appeared to me in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</verse>
    <verse num="4">and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and make you numerous, and will make you a company of nations. And I will give this land to your offspring after you <transChange type="added">as</transChange> an everlasting possession.'</verse>
    <verse num="5">And now, your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before my coming to you in Egypt, are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine as Reuben and Simeon <transChange type="added">are</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And your children whom you father after them shall be yours. By the name of their brothers they shall be called, with respect to their inheritance.</verse>
    <verse num="7">As for me, when I came to Paddan-Aram Rachel died {to my sorrow}<note>Literally "to me"</note> in the land of Canaan on the way when <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> still some distance to go to Ephrath. And I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that <transChange type="added">is</transChange>, Bethlehem)."</verse>
    <verse num="8">When Israel saw the sons of Joseph he said, "Who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> these?"</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Joseph said to his father, "They <transChange type="added">are</transChange> my sons whom God has given me here." And he said, "Please bring them to me that I may bless them."</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now the eyes of Israel were dim<note>Or "heavy" (i.e., his eyelids were heavy; his eyes were closed)</note> on account of old age; he was not able to see. So he brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Israel said to Joseph, "I did not expect to see your face and behold, God has also shown me your offspring."</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Joseph removed them from his knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Joseph took the two of them, Ephraim at his right <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the left of Israel, and Manasseh at his left <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the right of Israel. And he brought them near to him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Israel stretched out his right hand and put <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on the head of Ephraim (now he was the younger), and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands, for Manasseh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the firstborn.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he blessed Joseph and said, </verse>
    <verse num="16">The angel who redeemed me from all evil, may he bless the boys. And through them let my name be perpetuated,<note>Or "called"</note> and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac. And let them multiply into many in the midst of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="17">When Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, he was displeased. And he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from the head of Ephraim <transChange type="added">over</transChange> to the head of Manasseh.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father; because this one <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the firstborn. Put your right <transChange type="added">hand</transChange> upon his head."</verse>
    <verse num="19">But his father refused and said, "I know, my son; I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great, but his younger brother shall be greater than him, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations."</verse>
    <verse num="20">So he blessed them that day, saying, </verse>
    <verse num="21">And Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I <transChange type="added">am about</transChange> to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">And I have given to you one slope <transChange type="added">of land</transChange> rather than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorites by my sword and with my bow." </verse>

  <chapter num="49">
    <verse num="1">Then Jacob called his sons and said, "Gather together so that I can tell you what will happen with you in {days to come}.<note>Literally "the latter days"</note> </verse>

  <chapter num="50">
    <verse num="1">Then Joseph fell on the face of his father and wept upon him and kissed him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Joseph instructed his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Forty days {were required for it},<note>Literally "were fulfilled for it"</note> for thus <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the days {required for}<note>Literally "fulfilled"</note> embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.</verse>
    <verse num="4">When the days of his weeping had passed, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="5">'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I <transChange type="added">am about</transChange> to die. In the tomb that I have hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan--there you must bury me." So then, please let me go up and let me bury my father; then I will return.'"</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father as he made you swear."</verse>
    <verse num="7">So Joseph went up to bury his father. And all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, went up with him,</verse>
    <verse num="8">with all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and the household of his father. They left only their little children and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And there also went up with him chariots and horsemen. The company <transChange type="added">was</transChange> very great.</verse>
    <verse num="10">When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful wailing. And he made a mourning ceremony for his father seven days.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And when the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, saw the mourning ceremony at the threshing floor of Atad they said, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a severe mourning for the Egyptians." Therefore its name was called Abel-Mizraim, which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> beyond the Jordan.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Thus his sons did to him just as he had instructed them.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which field Abraham had bought as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite before<note>Or "east of"</note> Mamre.</verse>

    <verse num="16">So they sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to Joseph saying, "Your father commanded <transChange type="added">us</transChange> before his death, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="17">"Thus you must say to Joseph, 'O, please now forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did evil to you.' So now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then his brothers went also and fell before him and said, "Behold, we <transChange type="added">are</transChange> your servants."</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then Joseph said to them, "Do not be afraid, for <transChange type="added">am</transChange> I in the place of God?</verse>

    <verse num="22">So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and the house of his father. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Joseph saw Ephraim's children to the third generation. Moreover, the children of Makir, son of Manasseh, were born on the knees of Joseph.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Joseph said to his brothers, "I <transChange type="added">am about</transChange> to die, but God will certainly visit you and bring you up from this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall bring up my bones from here."</verse>
    <verse num="26">So Joseph died, <transChange type="added">being</transChange> one hundred and ten years old. They embalmed him and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt. </verse>
