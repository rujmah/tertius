  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">{After}<note>Literally "And it happened after"</note> the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and he stayed at Ziklag two days.</verse>
    <verse num="2">On the third day, a man came from the camp from <transChange type="added">being with</transChange> Saul, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. {When he came}<note>Literally "And it happened at his coming"</note> to David, he fell to the ground and bowed down.</verse>
    <verse num="3">David said to him, "Where did you come from?" He said to him, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then David said to him, "{How did things go}?<note>Literally "What <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the thing"</note> Please tell me." He answered, "{When}<note>Literally "That"</note> the army fled from the battle, and many of the people fell; also, Saul and Jonathan his son died."</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then David asked the young man who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> reporting to him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan died?"</verse>
    <verse num="6">The young man who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> reporting to him said, "I merely happened to be on Mount Gilboa. Here Saul <transChange type="added">was</transChange> leaning on his spear, and look, the chariots and the horsemen <transChange type="added">were</transChange> getting close to him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">When he turned around and saw me, he called to me, and I said, 'Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>.'</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then he said to me, 'Who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you?' And I said to him, 'I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> an Amalekite.'</verse>
    <verse num="9">He said to me, 'Please stand over me and kill me, for convulsions have seized me, even though my life <transChange type="added">is still</transChange> in me.'</verse>
    <verse num="10">So I stood over him and killed him, for I knew that he could not live after his falling; I took the crown that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on his head and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> bracelet which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on his arm; and here, I have brought them to my lord.</verse>
    <verse num="11">David grabbed <transChange type="added">at</transChange> his clothes and tore them, <transChange type="added">as did</transChange> all of the men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then they mourned and wept and fasted over Saul and Jonathan his son until the evening, <transChange type="added">as well</transChange> as over the people of Yahweh and over the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then David said to the young man who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> reporting to him, "Where <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you from?" And he said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> the son of an alien man. I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> an Amalekite."</verse>
    <verse num="14">David said to him, "How <transChange type="added">is it that</transChange> you <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed one?"</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then David called to one of the young men and said to him, "Come near; strike him." So he struck him down and he died.</verse>
    <verse num="16">David said to him, "Your blood <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on your head, for your mouth has testified against you by saying, 'I killed Yahweh's anointed one!'" </verse>
    <verse num="17">Then David sang this funeral song over Saul and over Jonathan his son.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he ordered "The Bow" to be taught to the children of Judah. Look, it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> written on the scroll of Jashar.<note>The Book of Jashar ("the upright") is also mentioned in Josh 10:13.</note> </verse>
    <verse num="19">"The glory of Israel <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on your high places; how <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mighty have fallen!</verse>
    <verse num="20">Do not tell it in Gath; do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.</verse>
    <verse num="21">O mountains of Gilboa, <transChange type="added">let there be</transChange> no dew or rain upon you or on the fields of <transChange type="added">grain for</transChange> offerings, for there the small shield of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mighty <transChange type="added">was</transChange> defiled, the small shield of Saul <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not anointed with oil.</verse>
    <verse num="22">From the blood of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> slain, from the fat of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, and the sword of Saul did not return {without effect}.<note>Literally "empty handedly"</note></verse>
    <verse num="23">Saul and Jonathan <transChange type="added">were</transChange> beloved and pleasant in their lives and <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not separated in their death. They <transChange type="added">were</transChange> swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.</verse>
    <verse num="24">O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, the one who clothed you with crimson, the one who {adorned your clothing with golden ornaments}.<note>Literally "put gold ornaments on your clothing"</note></verse>
    <verse num="25">How <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle; Jonathan <transChange type="added">lies</transChange> slain on your high places.</verse>
    <verse num="26">{I am distressed}<note>Literally "Distress <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for me"</note> over you, my brother Jonathan. you <transChange type="added">were</transChange> very dear to me; your love <transChange type="added">was</transChange> more wonderful to me than the love of women.</verse>
    <verse num="27">How <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mighty have fallen and the weapons of warfare perished."</verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">It happened after this that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, "Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?" And Yahweh said to him, "Go up." David asked, "Where shall I go up?" And he said, "To Hebron."</verse>
    <verse num="2">So David went up there {along with}<note>Literally "and also"</note> his two wives, Ahinoam {from Jezreel}<note>Literally "the Jezreelitess"</note> and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Also, David brought up his men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, each {with}<note>Literally "and"</note> his household, and they settled in the towns of Hebron. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the men of Judah came, and they anointed David there as king over the house of Judah, and they told David, "The men of Jabesh-Gilead buried Saul."</verse>
    <verse num="5">So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead and said to them, "May you be blessed by Yahweh because you did this loyal love with your lord, with Saul, and you buried him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now may Yahweh show loyal love and faithfulness with you. I will also show the good with you that you have done in this matter.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So then, let your hands be strong and {be valiant},<note>Literally "as sons of ability"</note> for your lord Saul <transChange type="added">is</transChange> dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them." </verse>
    <verse num="8">But Abner the son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Mahanaim.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over Israel, all of it.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul <transChange type="added">was</transChange> forty years old when he became king over Israel and he reigned two years; however, the house of Judah {followed}<note>Literally "were after"</note> David.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The number of days that David was king over Hebron, over the house of Judah, <transChange type="added">was</transChange> seven years and six months. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out, and they met at the pool of Gibeon. The one group sat on one side of the pool, and the other sat on the other side.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men come up and fight in our presence." And Joab said, "Let them come up."</verse>
    <verse num="15">So they came forward and passed by in number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then each seized his {opponent}<note>Literally "neighbor"</note> by the head and <transChange type="added">each thrust</transChange> his sword in the side of his opponent, so they fell together. So they<note>Hebrew "he"</note> called the name of that place Helkath Hazzurim,<note>Helkath Hazzurim possibly means "the slippery slope"</note> which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Gibeon.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then the battle {became increasingly fierce}<note>Literally "and it was/became strong/fierce until very"</note> on that day, and Abner and the men of Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> defeated before the servants of David. </verse>
    <verse num="18">The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> swift with his feet as one of the gazelles which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the open field.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So Asahel pursued<note>Hebrew "pursued after"</note> Abner, and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left from going after Abner.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Abner turned around and said, "<transChange type="added">Are</transChange> you this Asahel?" And he said, "Yes."</verse>
    <verse num="21">Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right or to your left; seize for yourself one of the young men, and take his belongings for yourself." But Asahel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not willing to turn aside from him.</verse>
    <verse num="22">So Abner said to Asahel {once again},<note>Literally "and he again did again"</note> "{For your own sake},<note>Literally "for yourself"</note> turn aside {from following me}.<note>Literally "from after me"</note> Why should I strike you down to the ground? How could I {show my face}<note>Literally "lift up my face"</note> to Joab your brother?"</verse>
    <verse num="23">But he refused to turn away, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of the spear, and the spear went out of his back. He fell there and he died {on the spot}.<note>Literally "in his place"</note> {Then}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> all who came to the place where Asahel fell and died <transChange type="added">just</transChange> stood there. </verse>
    <verse num="24">So Joab and Abishai pursued<note>Hebrew "pursued after"</note> Abner {when}<note>Literally "and"</note> the sun went down. And they came to the hill <transChange type="added">country</transChange> of Ammah, which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> {before Giah}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">lies</transChange> on the face of Giah"</note> <transChange type="added">on</transChange> the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
    <verse num="25">The descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Benjamin rallied after Abner, and they became as one fighting group and stood on the top of a certain hill.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then Abner called to Joab and said, "Will <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sword devour forever? Do you not know that <transChange type="added">there</transChange> will be bitterness in the end? {How long}<note>Literally "And up to when"</note> will you not tell the people to turn {away from pursuing}<note>Literally "from after"</note> their brothers?"</verse>
    <verse num="27">Joab said, "{As God lives},<note>Literally "The life of God"</note> for if you had not spoken, the people would surely have gone up in the morning, each <transChange type="added">one of them</transChange> {from following after}<note>Literally "from after"</note> his brother."</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then Joab blew on the trumpet and all the people stopped, and they no longer pursued after Israel, and they did not fight with them again. </verse>
    <verse num="29">Then Abner and his men went through the Arabah all that night, and they crossed over the Jordan. They went all the forenoon and came to Mahanaim.</verse>
    <verse num="30">After Joab returned from <transChange type="added">pursuing</transChange><note>Hebrew "after"</note> Abner, he gathered all the people; nineteen of the servants of David <transChange type="added">were</transChange> missing <transChange type="added">along</transChange> with Asahel.</verse>
    <verse num="31">The servants of David had killed some of the Benjaminites among the men of Abner; three hundred and sixty men had died.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then they picked up Asahel and buried him in the grave of his father, which <transChange type="added">was at</transChange> Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all that night {<transChange type="added">arriving</transChange> in Hebron at first light}.<note>Literally "it became light for them in Hebron"</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">The battle <transChange type="added">was</transChange> prolonged between the house of Saul and the house of David, but David {<transChange type="added">was</transChange> growing stronger and stronger}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">was</transChange> going and strong"</note> while the house of Saul {<transChange type="added">was</transChange> becoming weaker and weaker}.<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">was</transChange> going and weak"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">And sons <transChange type="added">were</transChange> born to David in Hebron; his firstborn <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Amnon by Ahinoam {from Jezreel}<note>Literally "the Jezreelitess"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="3">His second <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Kileab by Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; the third <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Absalom the son of Maacah, <transChange type="added">who was</transChange> the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur.</verse>
    <verse num="4">The fourth <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Shephatiah the son of Abital.</verse>
    <verse num="5">The sixth <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Ithream by Eglah the wife of David. These <transChange type="added">were</transChange> born to David in Hebron. </verse>
    <verse num="6">As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David was <transChange type="added">continuing</transChange>, Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Saul had had a concubine, and her name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Rizpah the daughter of Aiah. Then <transChange type="added">Ish-Bosheth</transChange><note>Supported by some Hebrew and Greek manuscripts</note> said to Abner, "Why {did you have sex with}<note>Literally "have you gone into"</note> my father's concubine?"</verse>
    <verse num="8">{Abner became very angry}<note>Literally "And it became hot for Abner very"</note> at the words of Ish-Bosheth, and he said, "<transChange type="added">Am</transChange> I the head of a dog which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for Judah today? Do I not continue to show loyal love with the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends? I have not let you fall into the hands of David, yet you have {accused me of sin with this woman}<note>Literally "you have called me into account with the guilt of the woman"</note> today.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Thus {may God punish Abner},<note>Literally "may God do to Abner, and thus may he add to it"</note> {if I do not accomplish what Yahweh has sworn to David};<note>Literally "for as that Yahweh has sworn to David, so I will accomplish for him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10"><transChange type="added">specifically,</transChange> to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan to Beersheba!"</verse>
    <verse num="11">And <transChange type="added">Ish-Bosheth</transChange> was no longer able to {answer}<note>Literally "return a word to"</note> Abner {because he feared him}.<note>Literally "because of his fearing him"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="12">Abner sent messengers to David {where he was},<note>Literally "under him"</note> saying, "To whom does the land <transChange type="added">belong</transChange>? {Make your covenant with me}!<note>Literally "cut your covenant with me"</note> Look, my hand <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with you to bring all of Israel over to you!"</verse>
    <verse num="13">He<note>David</note> said, "Good. {I will make a covenant with you}.<note>Literally "I will cut a covenant with you"</note> I am asking only one thing from you: You shall not see my face unless you bring Michal the daughter of Saul when you come to see {me}."<note>Literally "my face"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, saying, "Give <transChange type="added">me</transChange> my wife Michal whom I betrothed to myself<note>Hebrew "me"</note> for a hundred foreskins of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines."</verse>
    <verse num="15">So Ish-Bosheth sent and took her from <transChange type="added">her</transChange> husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.<note>The Hebrew Masoretic text (Kethib) reads "Lush"; Qere reads "Laish"</note></verse>
    <verse num="16">But her husband went with her, {weeping all along}<note>Literally "going and weeping"</note> after her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go <transChange type="added">and</transChange> return." So he returned. </verse>
    <verse num="17">The word of Abner {came to}<note>Literally "was with"</note> the elders of Israel, saying, "{For quite some time}<note>Literally "Both yesterday and the day before"</note> you were seeking David as king over you.</verse>
    <verse num="18">So then, bring it about, because Yahweh had said to David, "Through the hand of David my servant <transChange type="added">I am about</transChange> to save my people Israel from the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies."</verse>
    <verse num="19">Abner also spoke {privately to Benjamin}.<note>Literally "in the ears of Benjamin"</note> Abner also went {to speak to David}<note>Literally "to speak in the ears of David"</note> in Hebron, all that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin. </verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Abner came to David in Hebron and with him <transChange type="added">were</transChange> twenty men. David had prepared a feast for Abner and for the men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Abner said to David, "Let me get up and go and gather all of Israel to my lord the king, that they may {make a covenant}<note>Literally "cut a covenant"</note> with you so you can reign over all which your soul desires." So David dismissed Abner, and he left in peace.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And look, the servants of David and Joab came from the raid, and they brought much plunder with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he<note>David</note> had dismissed him, and he had gone in peace.</verse>
    <verse num="23">When Joab and all the army that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him came, they told Joab, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he left in peace." </verse>
    <verse num="24">Then Joab came to the king and said, "What have you done? Abner came here to you? Why have you dismissed him that he {actually went away}?<note>Literally "and he went going"</note></verse>
    <verse num="25">You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you. He came to learn about your going out and coming <transChange type="added">in</transChange> and to know all which you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> doing."</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then Joab went out from David, and he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from Bor Hasirah, but David did not know <transChange type="added">it</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="27">When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to speak with him in private. Then he struck him in the stomach there and he died, {for he had shed the blood of Asahel his brother}.<note>Literally "for the blood of Asahel his brother." See Num 35:16-25</note></verse>
    <verse num="28">When David heard this afterwards, he said: "I and my kingdom <transChange type="added">are</transChange> innocent {before Yahweh}<note>Literally "from with Yahweh"</note> forever <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
    <verse num="29">May <transChange type="added">the blood</transChange> come down on the head of Joab and all the house of his father. {May the house of Joab never lack}<note>Literally "May <transChange type="added">there</transChange> not be cut off from the house of Joab"</note> <transChange type="added">one with</transChange> a bodily discharge or <transChange type="added">one with</transChange> leprosy or <transChange type="added">one who</transChange> grasps the distaff or <transChange type="added">one who</transChange> falls by the sword or <transChange type="added">one who is</transChange> lacking food." </verse>
    <verse num="30">So Joab and Abishai, his brother, killed Abner because he had killed Asahel, their brother, at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
    <verse num="31">David said to Joab and to all the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, "Tear your clothing and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner." Now King David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> following after the bier.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And they buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.</verse>
    <verse num="33">The king sang a lament for Abner and said, "Should Abner have died the death of a fool?</verse>
    <verse num="34">Your hands <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not tied and your feet <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not in contact with bronze fetters. You have fallen as one who falls before sons of wickedness." Then {all the people wept over him again}.<note>Literally "and all the people did again to weep over him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="35">Then all the people came to give David food. Still on that day, David swore, "{May God punish me}<note>Literally "Thus may God do to me and thus may he add"</note> if I taste food or anything before the sun goes down."</verse>
    <verse num="36">All the people noticed, and it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> good in their eyes, as everything that the king did <transChange type="added">was</transChange> good in the eyes of all the people.</verse>
    <verse num="37">Then all the people and all of Israel realized on that day that {the king had not desired}<note>Literally "that it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not from the king"</note> to kill Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
    <verse num="38">Then the king said to his servants, "Did you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel?</verse>
    <verse num="39">I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> weak today even though anointed king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> crueler than I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>. May Yahweh pay them back for doing wickedness according to their <transChange type="added">own</transChange> wickedness." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">When the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, {his courage failed}<note>Literally "his hands hung limp"</note> and all of Israel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> horrified.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Two of the men, commanders of the raiding bands, were <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the son of Saul. The name of one <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Baanah, and the name of the other <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Recab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Benjamin; also, Beeroth <transChange type="added">was</transChange> regarded <transChange type="added">as belonging</transChange> to Benjamin.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and they are resident aliens there until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="4">(Now Jonathan the son of Saul had a son who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> crippled in the feet. He <transChange type="added">was</transChange> five years old when the message of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse had picked him up and fled. It happened that as she <transChange type="added">was</transChange> hurrying away to flee, he fell and became crippled. His name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Mephibosheth.)</verse>
    <verse num="5">When the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Recab and Baanah, set out, they came at the heat of the day to the house of Ish-Bosheth while {he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> taking a noontime rest}.<note>Literally "he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> lying with the bed at noon"</note></verse>
    <verse num="6">They came as far as the middle of the house <transChange type="added">as if</transChange> takers of wheat, and they struck him in the stomach. Then Recab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
    <verse num="7">When they had come <transChange type="added">into</transChange> the house, he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> lying on his couch {in his bedchamber},<note>Literally "in the room of his lying"</note> and they attacked him and killed him. Then they {beheaded him},<note>Literally "they took away his head"</note> and they took his head and went on the way of the Arabah all night.</verse>
    <verse num="8">They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron, and they said to the king, "Here <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the head of Ish-Bosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life. Yahweh has given to my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and on his offspring."</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then David answered Recab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and he said to them, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> who redeemed my soul from all trouble,</verse>
    <verse num="10">when the <transChange type="added">one</transChange> who told me, "Look, Saul <transChange type="added">is</transChange> dead," {thought that he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> bringing good news},<note>Literally "and he was as <transChange type="added">one</transChange> bringing good news in his eyes"</note> I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> as my giving the news <transChange type="added">back</transChange> to him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">{How much more}<note>Literally "Also"</note> when wicked men kill a righteous man in his house, on his bed! So then, shall I not seek his lifeblood from your hand, so that I may destroy you from the earth?"</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them, and they cut off their hands and their feet, and they hung <transChange type="added">them</transChange> at the pool at Hebron, but the head of Ish-Bosheth they took and buried in the grave of Abner at Hebron. </verse>

  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">So all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and they said, "Here we <transChange type="added">are</transChange>, {we are your flesh and blood}.<note>Literally "We <transChange type="added">are</transChange> your bone and your flesh"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">{For some time},<note>Literally "Both yesterday and three days before"</note> when Saul was king over us, {you were leading Israel in and out}.<note>Literally "you were going out and coming in, Israel." (So Kethib; Qere reads "bringing out and bringing in Israel")</note> Yahweh had said to you, 'You shall be the shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be the leader over Israel.'"</verse>
    <verse num="3">All the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David {made a covenant}<note>Literally "cut a covenant"</note> with them at Hebron in the presence of Yahweh; then they anointed David as king over Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="4">David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He reigned over Judah at Hebron <transChange type="added">for</transChange> seven years and six months; and he reigned over all Israel and Judah at Jerusalem <transChange type="added">for</transChange> thirty-three years. </verse>
    <verse num="6">The king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. They said to David, "You will not come here, for even the blind and the lame can turn you back, saying, 'David cannot come here.'"</verse>
    <verse num="7">David captured the fortress of Zion, the city of David.</verse>
    <verse num="8">David had said, "On that day {when we attack the Jebusites},<note>Literally "in all of the striking down the Jebusites"</note> one must attack the lame and the blind, <transChange type="added">those</transChange> who hate the soul of David, by <transChange type="added">means of</transChange> the water supply." For thus the blind and the lame would say, "He cannot come into the house."</verse>
    <verse num="9">David occupied the fortress and called it the city of David. And David built all around <transChange type="added">it</transChange> from the Millo and {inward}.<note>Literally "to the house"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="10">David {continued growing stronger and stronger},<note>Literally "went going and great"</note> and Yahweh the God of hosts <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, <transChange type="added">along with</transChange> cedar trees and {craftsmen skilled in wood and in stone masonry},<note>Literally "skilled craftsmen of wood and skilled craftsmen of stone wall"</note> and they built a house for David.</verse>
    <verse num="12">David realized that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his people Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="13">David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters <transChange type="added">were</transChange> born to him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">These <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the names of the ones born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon;</verse>
    <verse num="15">Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia;</verse>
    <verse num="16">Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet. </verse>
    <verse num="17">When <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel, all <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines went up to seek David, but David heard and went down to the stronghold.<note>Thought by many to be the stronghold of Masada</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">Now <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines had come, and they spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, "Shall I go up to the Philistines? Will you give them into my hands?" Yahweh said to David, "Go up, for {I will certainly give}<note>Literally "giving I will give"</note> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines into your hand."</verse>
    <verse num="20">So David came to Baal Perazim and defeated them there; and David said, "Yahweh has burst through my enemies before me like the bursting of water." Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.<note>Baal Perazim may mean "the master of the bursting through"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">They had left their idols there, so David and his men carried them away. </verse>
    <verse num="22">{Once again}<note>Literally "And they again did again"</note> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.</verse>
    <verse num="23">So David inquired of Yahweh, but he said, "You shall not go up. <transChange type="added">Rather,</transChange> go around to their rear and come to them from opposite the balsam trees.</verse>
    <verse num="24">{And it shall be}<note>Literally "And it shall happen"</note> that when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then pay attention, for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike down the army of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines."</verse>
    <verse num="25">So David did thus, just as Yahweh had commanded him, and he struck down <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines from Geba {all the way}<note>Literally "as you go up"</note> to Gezer. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">David again gathered all the chosen men in Israel, thirty thousand.</verse>
    <verse num="2">David got up and went and all the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> called the name, the name of Yahweh of hosts, {upon which the cherubim sit}.<note>Literally "the cherubim <transChange type="added">are</transChange> sitting on him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">They loaded the ark of God on a new utility cart, and they carried it from the house of Abinadab, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on the hill. Now Uzza and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, <transChange type="added">were</transChange> driving the new utility cart along.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So they brought it out from the house of Abinadab, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on the hill with the ark of God, and Ahio <transChange type="added">was</transChange> going before the ark.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now David and all the house of Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> dancing before Yahweh, with all kinds of <transChange type="added">musical instruments made from</transChange> ash trees, and with zithers, harps, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.</verse>
    <verse num="6">When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzza reached out to the ark of God and took hold of <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, because the oxen had stumbled.</verse>
    <verse num="7">{Then the anger of Yahweh was kindled}<note>Literally "Then the nose of Yahweh became hot"</note> against Uzza, and God struck him down there because of the indiscretion,<note>Legal regulations offered by Moses did not permit an Israelite to handle the ark of the covenant in this manner (compare Exod 25:12-16)</note> and he died there beside the ark of God.</verse>
    <verse num="8">{David was angry}<note>Literally "It was hot for David"</note> because Yahweh had burst out against Uzza, and he called that place Perez-Uzza until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But David feared Yahweh on that day and said, "How can the ark of Yahweh come to me?"</verse>
    <verse num="10">However, David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not willing to bring the ark of Yahweh to himself, to the city of David, so David caused it to turn <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So the ark of Yahweh remained <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite <transChange type="added">for</transChange> three months, and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and all his household. </verse>
    <verse num="12">It <transChange type="added">was</transChange> told to King David, "Yahweh has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his because of the ark of God." So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with jubilation.</verse>
    <verse num="13">It happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when the carriers of the ark of Yahweh had marched six steps that he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Now David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> dancing with all <transChange type="added">his</transChange> might before Yahweh, and David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> wearing<note>Hebrew "girded with"</note> a linen ephod.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So David and all the house of Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> bringing up the ark of Yahweh with shouts of joyful acclaim and with the sound of the trumpet.</verse>
    <verse num="16">It happened that when the ark of Yahweh came <transChange type="added">into</transChange> the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before Yahweh, and she despised him in her heart. </verse>
    <verse num="17">They brought the ark of Yahweh and set it in its place in the middle of the tent which David had pitched for it. Then David offered up burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="18">When David had finished from the sacrificing of the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, from man to woman, to each: one ring-shaped piece of bread, one cake of dates, and one cake of raisins; and all the people went each to his house. </verse>
    <verse num="20">When David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David. She said, "How the king of Israel honored himself today {by uncovering himself}<note>Literally "who has uncovered himself"</note> before the eyes of the maids of his servants, {as the total exposure of a worthless one}."<note>Literally "as the total uncovering of one of the worthless"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">So David said to Michal, "<transChange type="added">In the</transChange> presence of Yahweh who chose me {over}<note>Literally "more than"</note> your father and {over}<note>Literally "more than"</note> his household, to appoint me <transChange type="added">as</transChange> leader over the people of Yahweh, over Israel, I have celebrated before Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="22">I will demean myself again more than this, and I will be abased in my eyes, but with the maids whom you mentioned, with them I will be honored."</verse>
    <verse num="23">So for Michal the daughter of Saul, she had no child until the day of her death. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">It happened that the king settled in his house. (Now Yahweh had given rest to him from all his enemies all around.)</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the king said to Nathan the prophet, "Look, please, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> staying in the middle of the tent."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Nathan said to the king, "Go and do all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in your heart, for Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with you."</verse>
    <verse num="4">But it happened {that night},<note>Literally "in the night the that"</note> the word of Yahweh came<note>Hebrew "was"</note> to Nathan, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="5">"Go and tell my servant David, 'Thus says Yahweh: "<transChange type="added">Are</transChange> you the one to build for me a house for my dwelling?</verse>
    <verse num="6">For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought up the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> from Egypt until this day; <transChange type="added">rather,</transChange> I <transChange type="added">was</transChange> going about in a tent and in a tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse num="7">In all of my going about among all the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> did I speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, 'Why did you not build me a cedar house?'" '</verse>
    <verse num="8">So then, thus you shall say to my servant David, 'Thus says Yahweh of hosts, "I took you from the pasture {from following}<note>Literally "from behind"</note> the sheep to be a leader over my people, over Israel,</verse>

    <verse num="11">{In the manner that}<note>Literally "And as far as" or "And from the day"</note> I appointed judges over my people Israel, I will give you rest from all your enemies. And Yahweh declares to you that Yahweh will build a house for you.</verse>
    <verse num="12">When your days <transChange type="added">are</transChange> full and you lie down with your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> I will raise up your offspring after you who will go out from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</verse>
    <verse num="14">I will be a father to him, and he will be a son for me, whom I will punish when he does wrong, with a rod of men and with blows of the {human beings}.<note>Literally "children of men"</note></verse>

    <verse num="17">According to all these words and according to all this vision, this Nathan spoke to David.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then King David went and sat before Yahweh and said, "Who <transChange type="added">am</transChange> I, my lord Yahweh, and what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my house that you have brought me up to {this place}?<note>Literally "here"</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">Still, this <transChange type="added">was</transChange> {insignificant}<note>Literally "small"</note> in your eyes, my lord Yahweh, and also you have spoken about the house of your servant from afar, and this <transChange type="added">may be</transChange> the teaching of humans, my lord Yahweh.</verse>

    <verse num="22">Therefore you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> great, my lord Yahweh, for there is no one like you, and there <transChange type="added">is</transChange> no god except you, in all that we have heard with our ears.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like your people, like Israel? <transChange type="added">Israel is</transChange> the one nation on earth whose God {led them},<note>Literally "went"; LXX reads "led"</note> <transChange type="added">in order</transChange> to redeem a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to do for you<note>David switches pronouns from the third person to the second person</note> the great and awesome things for your land in the presence of your people whom he redeemed for himself from Egypt, <transChange type="added">from the</transChange> nations and their gods.</verse>
    <verse num="24">You have established your people Israel for yourself as a people forever, and you, O Yahweh, have become their God.</verse>
    <verse num="25">So then, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do just as you have promised.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Your name shall be great forever, {and they will say},<note>Literally "saying"</note> 'Yahweh of hosts <transChange type="added">is</transChange> God over Israel'; and the house of your servant David shall be established before you.</verse>
    <verse num="27">For you, O Yahweh of hosts, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> God of Israel!

    <verse num="1">It happened afterwards <transChange type="added">that</transChange> David attacked <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg Ammah from the hands of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines.</verse>
    <verse num="2">When he defeated Moab, he measured them with the cord, making them lie on the ground. He measured two cords to kill and {the third cord}<note>Literally "the filling of a cord"</note> to let live.<note>This method of selection must have been well known to the reader, but the exact procedure has been obscured over the millennia. It may be that one out of three lived through the process, only to become subservient</note> So Moab became servants of David, bringing tribute.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then David struck down Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to restore his monument<note>Hebrew "hand"</note> at the Euphrates River.</verse>
    <verse num="4">David captured from him one thousand and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand {foot soldiers}.<note>Literally "men of infantry"</note> David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but {from them}<note>Literally "from him"</note> he spared a hundred chariot horses.</verse>
    <verse num="5">When Aram of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand men of Aram.</verse>
    <verse num="6">David placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, so Aram became servants of David, bringing tribute. Yahweh protected David everywhere he went. </verse>
    <verse num="7">David took the small round gold shields which had {belonged}<note>Literally "been"</note> to the servants of Hadadezer, and he brought them <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="8">From Betah and from Berothai, the towns of Hadadezer, King David took very many bronze <transChange type="added">items</transChange>. </verse>

    <verse num="3">Then the king said, "But <transChange type="added">is</transChange> there still anyone of Saul's household that I may show the loyal love of God with him?"

    <verse num="10">The rest of the army he placed into the hand of his brother Abishai, who {arranged them in battle lines}<note>Literally "arrayed"</note> to meet the {Ammonites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note></verse>
    <verse num="11">Then he said, "If Aram <transChange type="added">is</transChange> stronger than I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>, you must become my deliverer; but if the {Ammonites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> <transChange type="added">are</transChange> too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves for the sake of the people and for the sake of the cities of our God. May Yahweh do <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> good in his eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Joab and all the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him moved forward into the battle against Aram, and they fled from before him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">When the {Ammonites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> saw that Aram had fled, they fled from before Abishai and entered the city.

    <verse num="15">When the Arameans saw that they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> defeated before Israel, they gathered themselves together.</verse>

    <verse num="17">David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> told, so he gathered all Israel and crossed over the Jordan and came to Helam. Aram {arranged themselves in battle lines}<note>Literally "arrayed"</note> to meet David, and they fought with him.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Aram fled before Israel, and David killed from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans seven hundred chariot teams and forty thousand horsemen. He struck down Shobach, the commander of his army, and he died there.</verse>
    <verse num="19">When all the kings, the servants of Hadadezer, saw that he had been defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them, and Aram <transChange type="added">was</transChange> afraid to help the {Ammonites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> any longer. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">{It came about in the spring},<note>Literally "And it happened at the turn of the year"</note> at the time {kings}<note>According to the reading tradition (Qere); Kethib has "angels" or "messengers"</note> go out, David sent Joab and his servants with him and all of Israel. They ravaged all of the {Ammonites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> and besieged Rabbah, but David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> remaining in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="2">It happened {late one afternoon}<note>Literally "at the time of the evening"</note> <transChange type="added">that</transChange> David got up from his bed and walked about on the roof of the king's house, and he saw a woman bathing on her<note>Hebrew "the"</note> roof. Now the woman {was very beautiful}.<note>Literally "very good of appearance"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">David sent and inquired about the woman, and <transChange type="added">someone</transChange> said, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> this not Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) And she returned to her house.</verse>
    <verse num="5">The woman became pregnant, and she sent and told David, and she said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> pregnant."</verse>
    <verse num="6">So David sent to Joab, "Send Uriah the Hittite to me." So Joab sent Uriah to David.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Uriah came to him, and David asked {how Joab and the army fared and how the war was going}.<note>Literally "as far as the peace of Joab, as far as the peace of the army, and as far as the peace of the battle"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house, and wash your feet." So Uriah went out from the king's house, and a gift from the king went out after him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But Uriah slept <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the entrance of the king's house with all the servants of his master and did not go down to his house.</verse>
    <verse num="10">They told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house." David said to Uriah, "<transChange type="added">Are</transChange> you not coming from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"</verse>
    <verse num="11">Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah <transChange type="added">are</transChange> living in the booths; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord <transChange type="added">are</transChange> camping on the surface of the open field; and I, shall I go to my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife? <transChange type="added">By</transChange> your life and the life of your soul, I surely will not do this thing."</verse>
    <verse num="12">David said to Uriah, "Remain here {today},<note>Literally "also the day"</note> and tomorrow I will send you away." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem on that day and the next.</verse>
    <verse num="13">David invited him, and he ate and drank in his presence {so that he became drunk},<note>Literally "and he made him drunk"</note> and he went out in the evening to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And it happened in the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and he sent it by the hand of Uriah.</verse>
    <verse num="15">He had written in the letter, "Put Uriah in the front, in the face of the fiercest fighting, then draw back from behind him so that he may be struck down and die." </verse>
    <verse num="16">{When Joab was besieging}<note>Literally "And it happened at the besieging of Joab"</note> the city, he put Uriah toward the place which he knew {there were valiant warriors}.<note>Literally "there <transChange type="added">were</transChange> men of ability"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">The men of the city came out and fought with Joab. Some from the army from the servants of David fell; Uriah the Hittite also died.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Joab sent and told David all of the news of the battle.</verse>
    <verse num="19">He instructed the messenger, saying, "As you are finishing to speak all the news of the battle to the king,</verse>
    <verse num="20">if the anger of the king rises and he says to you, 'Why did you go near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from <transChange type="added">atop</transChange> the wall?</verse>
    <verse num="21">Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerub-bosheth,<note>In putting words in David's mouth, Joab alludes to the story of Abimelech the son of Gideon from Judg 9:52-55. Though Gideon was also known as Jerub-ba'al, Joab conventionally substitutes bosheth (shame) for Ba'al to avoid naming the Canaanite deity</note> if not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from <transChange type="added">atop</transChange> the wall and he died at Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?' Then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.'"</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then the messenger left, and he came and told David all that Joab had sent him <transChange type="added">to say</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="23">The messenger said to David, "Because {the men overpowered us},<note>Literally "the men <transChange type="added">were</transChange> superior over us"</note> the men came out to us <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the field, but {we forced them back}<note>Literally "we <transChange type="added">were</transChange> upon them"</note> to the entrance of the gate.</verse>
    <verse num="24">The archers shot at your servant from <transChange type="added">atop</transChange> the wall, and some of the servants of the king died; your servant Uriah the Hittite also died."</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then David said to the messenger, "Thus you shall say to Joab, '{Do not feel badly about this matter};<note>Literally "Do not let his matter be evil in your eyes"</note> {now one and then another}<note>Literally "for as this and as this"</note> the sword will devour. Intensify your attack on the city and overthrow it.'" And he encouraged him.</verse>
    <verse num="26">When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband <transChange type="added">was</transChange> dead, she mourned over her husband.</verse>
    <verse num="27">When the mourning <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over, David sent and brought her to his household, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing which David had done <transChange type="added">was</transChange> evil in the eyes of Yahweh. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">So Yahweh sent Nathan to David, and he came to him and said, "Two men were in a certain city; one <transChange type="added">was</transChange> rich and the other <transChange type="added">was</transChange> poor.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The rich <transChange type="added">man</transChange> had very many flocks and herds,</verse>
    <verse num="3">but the poor <transChange type="added">man</transChange> had nothing except for one small ewe lamb which he had bought. He had nurtured her, and she grew up with him and with his children together. She used to eat from his morsel and drink from his cup, and she used to lie in his lap and became like a daughter for him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And a visitor came to the rich man, but he {was reluctant}<note>Literally "felt sorry"</note> to take from his flocks or from his herds to prepare a meal for the traveler when he came to him. So he took the ewe lamb of the poor man and prepared it for the man who had come to him."</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then {the anger of David was kindled}<note>Literally "the nose of David became very hot"</note> against the man, and he said to Nathan, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> the man who has done this {deserves to die}!<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">is</transChange> a son of death"</note></verse>
    <verse num="6">He shall restore the ewe lamb fourfold because he has done this thing, and because he had no pity."</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Nathan said to him, "You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the man! Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: 'I anointed you as king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.</verse>
    <verse num="8">I gave you the household of your master and the women of your master into your lap. I also gave you the house of Israel and Judah; if <transChange type="added">that had been too</transChange> little, I would have added to you {much more}.<note>Literally "as here and as here"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">Why have you despised the word of Yahweh by doing evil in his eyes?<note>Thus Kethib; the reading tradition (Qere) reads "my eyes"</note> Uriah the Hittite you have struck down with the sword, and his wife you have taken to yourself as wife! You have killed him with the sword of the {Ammonites}!<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">So then, a sword will not turn away from your house forever, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife!'</verse>
    <verse num="11">Thus says Yahweh, 'Look, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> going to raise up evil against you from <transChange type="added">within</transChange> your house, and I will take your women before your eyes, and I will give them to your neighbor, and he shall sleep with your wives {in broad daylight}.<note>Literally "before the eyes of this sun"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">Though you did this in secret, I will do this thing before all of Israel {in broad daylight}!'"<note>Literally "before the sun"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against Yahweh!"<note>See Pss 32:1-5; 51:1-13</note> Nathan said to David, "Yahweh has also forgiven your sin; you shall not die.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But because you have {utterly scorned}<note>Literally "scorning you have scorned." The term "enemies of" in the MT is likely a textual corruption and is deleted here</note> Yahweh in this matter, the son born for you {will certainly die}."<note>Literally "dying will die" (compare Gen 2:17)</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Nathan went to his house, and Yahweh struck the child that the wife of Uriah bore for David, and he became ill.</verse>
    <verse num="16">David pleaded <transChange type="added">with</transChange> God on behalf of the boy and David fasted. He went to spend the night and lay upon the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="17">The elders of his household stood over him to lift him up from the ground, but he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not willing, and he did not eat <transChange type="added">any</transChange> food with them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">It happened on the seventh day that the child died, and the servants of David <transChange type="added">were</transChange> afraid to tell him that the child <transChange type="added">was</transChange> dead, for they said, "Look, when the child <transChange type="added">was</transChange> alive, we spoke to him, but he would not listen to our voice. How can we tell him, 'The child <transChange type="added">is</transChange> dead'? He may do <transChange type="added">something</transChange> evil."</verse>
    <verse num="19">When David saw that his servants <transChange type="added">were</transChange> whispering together, he realized that the child <transChange type="added">was</transChange> dead. Then David said to his servants, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> the child dead?" And they said, "He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> dead."</verse>
    <verse num="20">David stood up from the ground and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothing. Then he went <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the house of Yahweh and worshiped, and he went to his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> house. He asked, so they served him food, and he ate.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then his servants said to him, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this thing that you have done? While the child <transChange type="added">was</transChange> alive, you fasted and wept; <transChange type="added">now</transChange> that the child has died, you get up and eat food!"</verse>
    <verse num="22">He said, "When the child <transChange type="added">was</transChange> still alive, I fasted and I wept because I thought, 'Who knows? Yahweh may have mercy on me that the child will live.'</verse>
    <verse num="23">But now he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> dead. Why <transChange type="added">should I be</transChange> fasting? <transChange type="added">Am</transChange> I able to return him again? I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> going to him, but he cannot return to me."</verse>
    <verse num="24">David consoled Bathsheba his wife, and he went to her and slept with her. She bore a son, and he called<note>So Kethib; Qere reads "she called"</note> him Solomon, and Yahweh loved him.</verse>
    <verse num="25">He sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> by the hand of Nathan the prophet, so he called him Jedidiah<note>Jedidiah means "beloved of Yahweh"</note> because of Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="26">And Joab fought against Rabbah of the {Ammonites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> and he captured {the royal city}.<note>Literally "city of the kingship"</note></verse>
    <verse num="27">Then Joab sent messengers to David and said, "We have fought against Rabbah, and we captured the city of the waters.</verse>
    <verse num="28">So then, gather the remainder of the army and encamp against the city and capture it, lest I capture the city and my name be proclaimed over it."</verse>
    <verse num="29">So David gathered all of the army, and he went to Rabbah and fought against it and captured it.</verse>
    <verse num="30">He took the crown of their king from his head. (Now its weight <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a talent of gold, and there <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a precious stone <transChange type="added">in it</transChange> and it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> put on David's head.) He brought out the plunder of the city {in great abundance}.<note>Literally "very many"</note></verse>
    <verse num="31">He also brought out the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in it and put them to the saws and to the iron picks and to the iron axes, and he sent them to the place of the brickmakers. Thus he used to do to all the cities of the {Ammonites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> and he and all of the army returned to Jerusalem. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">It happened afterwards that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Tamar, and Amnon the son of David fell in love with her.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Amnon {was so frustrated that he felt ill}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">was</transChange> distressed to the point of sickness"</note> because of Tamar his sister, because she <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a virgin, and it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> too difficult in Amnon's eyes to do anything with her.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Now Amnon had a friend whose name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David. (Now Jonadab <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a very crafty man.)</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he said to him, "Why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you so sullen {every morning},<note>Literally "in the morning, in the morning"</note> O son of the king? Will you not tell me?" And Amnon said to him, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom."</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed and appear ill. If your father comes to see you, you shall say to him, 'Please let Tamar my sister come and give me food to eat, and let her prepare the food before my eyes, in order that I may see it and eat from her hand.'"</verse>
    <verse num="6">So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill, and the king came to see him. Amnon said to the king, "Please let Tamar my sister come, and let her bake two cakes before my eyes that I may eat from her hand."</verse>
    <verse num="7">So David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, "Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare food for him."</verse>
    <verse num="8">Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother. Now he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> lying down, and she took the dough and kneaded <transChange type="added">it</transChange> and made cakes before his eyes, and she baked the cakes.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then she took the pan and poured it out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, "Let all <transChange type="added">the</transChange> men go out from me." So all <transChange type="added">the</transChange> men went out from him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the private room that I may eat from your hand." So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them to Amnon her brother in<note>Hebrew "to"</note> the private room.</verse>
    <verse num="11">When she brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister!"</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Tamar said to him, "No, my brother! Do not force me, for such a thing has not been done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing!</verse>
    <verse num="13">As for me, where should I take my disgrace? You will be as one of the fools in Israel. So please, speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you."</verse>
    <verse num="14">But he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not willing to listen to her voice. He <transChange type="added">was</transChange> stronger than she, and he forced her and lay with her. </verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Amnon hated her {very deeply},<note>Literally "with a great hatred"</note> for the hatred with which he hated her <transChange type="added">was</transChange> greater than <transChange type="added">the</transChange> love with which he had loved her. So Amnon said to her, "Get up <transChange type="added">and</transChange> go."</verse>
    <verse num="16">She said to him, "No, because this evil in sending me away <transChange type="added">is</transChange> greater than the other you have done to me." But he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not willing to listen to her.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then he called his young man who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> serving him and said, "Please send this woman from me to the outside, and bolt the door behind her!"</verse>
    <verse num="18">Now there <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a long-sleeved robe on her, for so they clothed the daughters of the king who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> virgins, in robes. His servant put her outside, and he bolted the door behind her.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Tamar put ashes on her head, and she tore the long-sleeved robe which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on her. She put her hand on her head, and {she went away, crying out as she went}.<note>Literally "she went, going and crying aloud"</note></verse>
    <verse num="20">Absalom her brother said to her, "<transChange type="added">Was</transChange> Amnon your brother with you? But now, my sister, be quiet; he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your brother. {Do not take this matter to heart}."<note>Literally "Do not place/set your heart to this matter"</note> So Tamar remained a desolate woman in the house of Absalom her brother. </verse>
    <verse num="21">Now King David heard all these things, and {he became very angry}.<note>Literally "it became very hot for him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">Absalom did not speak with Amnon {either bad or good},<note>Literally "as far as from bad and up to good"</note> for Absalom hated Amnon {over the matter when}<note>Literally "because of the thing that"</note> he raped Tamar his sister.</verse>
    <verse num="23">{About two full years later},<note>Literally "And it happened at two years <transChange type="added">of</transChange> days"</note> Absalom's shearers were in Baal Hazor, which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> near Ephraim, and Absalom summoned all the sons of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then Absalom went to the king and said, "Look, here <transChange type="added">are</transChange> your servant's shearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant.</verse>
    <verse num="25">The king said to Absalom, "No my son, not all of us shall go, so that we not be a burden to you." And he urged him, but he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not willing to go, but he blessed him.</verse>
    <verse num="26">So Absalom said, "But <transChange type="added">will you</transChange> not let Amnon my brother go with us?" And the king said to him, "Why should he go with you?"</verse>
    <verse num="27">But Absalom pressed him, so he sent Amnon with him and all of the sons of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Absalom commanded his servants, saying, "Please watch. At the moment the heart of Amnon <transChange type="added">is</transChange> {tipsy}<note>Literally "good"</note> with wine, then I shall say to you, 'Strike Amnon down,' and you shall kill him! Don't be afraid. <transChange type="added">Is</transChange> it not I myself who has commanded you? Be courageous and be {valiant!}<note>Literally "as sons of ability"</note></verse>
    <verse num="29">So Absalom's servants did to Amnon just as Absalom commanded, and all the sons of the king got up, and each mounted his mule and fled. </verse>
    <verse num="30">{While they were on the way},<note>Literally "And it happened they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> on the way"</note> the message came to David, "Absalom has killed all the sons of the king, and not one of them <transChange type="added">was</transChange> left."</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then the king rose and tore his garments, and he lay on the ground, and all his servants standing by <transChange type="added">were</transChange> tearing their garments.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David, responded and said, "My lord should not think that all the young men, the sons of the king, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> dead, because only Amnon <transChange type="added">is</transChange> dead. {Absalom was talking about it},<note>Literally "For it was on the mouth of Absalom"</note> as it was being determined from the day he<note>Amnon</note> raped Tamar his sister.</verse>
    <verse num="33">So then, let not my lord the king set his heart on this matter, thinking, 'All the sons of the king <transChange type="added">are</transChange> dead,' for only Amnon alone <transChange type="added">is</transChange> dead." </verse>
    <verse num="34">So Absalom fled, and the young man who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> keeping watch lifted up his eyes and saw, and there were many people coming from the road behind him from the side of the mountain.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Jonadab said to the king, "Look, the sons of the king have come. According to the word of your servant, so it has come about."</verse>
    <verse num="36">When he finished speaking, look, the sons of the king came and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also, the king and all his servants wept a very great weeping.</verse>
    <verse num="37">Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, the king of Geshur. <transChange type="added">David</transChange> mourned over his son {day after day}.<note>Literally "all the days"</note></verse>
    <verse num="38">But Absalom had fled and went <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Geshur, and he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> there three years.</verse>
    <verse num="39">King David longed to go out to Absalom, for he was consoled that Amnon had died. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="14">
    <verse num="1">Joab the son of Zeruiah realized that the mind of the king <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on Absalom.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So Joab sent to Tekoa and took from there a wise woman, and he said to her, "Please pretend to mourn and put on garments of mourning.

    <verse num="3">Then you must go to the king and speak to him according to this word." <transChange type="added">Thus</transChange> Joab put the words in her mouth. </verse>
    <verse num="4">So the Tekoite woman spoke to the king, and she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance. She said, "Help me, O king!"</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the king asked her, "{What do you want}?"<note>Literally "What is for you"</note> And she said, "Truly I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> a widow, and my husband <transChange type="added">is</transChange> dead.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Your servant had two sons, and they both fought in the open field, and there <transChange type="added">was</transChange> no one {to part them}.<note>Literally "to save between them"</note> One struck the other and killed him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And look, all of the family has risen up against your servant, and they said, 'Give up the one who struck his brother, that we may kill him in exchange for the life of his brother whom he murdered. We will also wipe out the heir,' and so they would put out my embers which remain, by not preserving for my husband a name and a remnant on the face of the earth." </verse>
    <verse num="8">Then the king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I myself will give the command concerning you."</verse>
    <verse num="9">The Tekoite woman said to the king, "On me, my lord the king, <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the guilt, and on the house of my father, but the king on<note>Hebrew "and"</note> his throne <transChange type="added">is</transChange> innocent."</verse>
    <verse num="10">The king said, "<transChange type="added">Whoever</transChange> has spoken to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you again."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then she said, "Please may the king remember Yahweh your God, {to prevent the increase of blood avengers who kill},<note>Literally "from making numerous the avenger of blood to kill"</note> <transChange type="added">so that they</transChange> not wipe out my son." He said, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> surely not one hair shall fall from your son to the ground."</verse>
    <verse num="12">The woman said, "Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king." And he said, "Speak."</verse>
    <verse num="13">The woman said, "But why have you plotted like this against the people of God? By speaking this word, he is guilty not to bring back his banished one.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For {we must certainly die},<note>Literally "dying we must die"</note> and <transChange type="added">we are</transChange> as the waters spilled to the ground which cannot be gathered. God will not take a life but devises plans for a banished person not to be cast out from him.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, because the people made me afraid, and your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king, perhaps the king will grant<note>Hebrew "do/make"</note> the request of his servant.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For the king will listen, to deliver his servant from the hand of the man <transChange type="added">who seeks</transChange> to destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.'</verse>
    <verse num="17">Your servant also thought, 'May the word of my lord the king {bring rest},<note>Literally "become a rest"</note> for as an angel of God, so <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my lord the king, {to sense what is good and what is bad}.'<note>Literally "to hear the good and the bad"</note> May Yahweh your God be with you."</verse>
    <verse num="18">The king answered and said to the woman, "Please do not withhold from me a thing which I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> about to ask you." The woman said, "Please let my lord the king speak."</verse>
    <verse num="19">The king asked, "<transChange type="added">Was</transChange> the hand of Joab with you in all of this?" The woman answered and said, "{As your soul lives},<note>Literally "The life of your soul"</note> my lord the king, surely <transChange type="added">one cannot</transChange> go to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken. Yes, your servant Joab himself commanded me, and he put all of these words in the mouth of your servant.</verse>
    <verse num="20">In order {to change the situation},<note>Literally "to turn the face of the thing"</note> your servant Joab did this thing. But my lord <transChange type="added">has</transChange> wisdom, as the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on the earth."</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then the king said to Joab, "Look, please, I will grant this thing. Go and bring back the young man Absalom."</verse>
    <verse num="22">Joab fell with his face to the ground and did obeisance. And he blessed the king, and he<note>Hebrew "Joab"</note> said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, <transChange type="added">in</transChange> that the king has granted the request of his servant." </verse>
    <verse num="23">Then Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="24">The king said, "Let him go over to his house, and he may not see my face." So Absalom went over to his house, and did not see the face of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="25">As far as Absalom, there was not a more handsome man in all of Israel to admire so much; from the sole of his foot up to his crown, there was no physical defect on him.</verse>
    <verse num="26">When he shaved his head, it would happen {every year},<note>Literally "from the end of days for the days"</note> which he did because <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> heavy on him, he would shave it off and weigh the hair of his head: two hundred shekels {by the king's weight}.<note>Literally "by the stone of the king"</note></verse>
    <verse num="27">Three sons <transChange type="added">were</transChange> born to Absalom and one daughter, whose name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Tamar. She <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a woman beautiful of appearance.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Absalom lived in Jerusalem {two full years},<note>Literally "two years of days"</note> but he did not see the face of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="29">So Absalom sent for Joab, <transChange type="added">in order that he</transChange> send him to the king, but he was not willing to go to him. He sent again a second <transChange type="added">time</transChange>, but he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not willing to go.</verse>
    <verse num="30">So he said to his servants, "Look at the tract of land of Joab {next to mine},<note>Literally "toward my hand"</note> for he has barley plants there. Go, set it ablaze with fire." So the servants of Absalom set the tract of land ablaze with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then Joab got up and went to Absalom, to the house, and said to him, "Why have your servants set my tract of land ablaze with fire?"</verse>
    <verse num="32">Absalom said to Joab, "Look, I have sent to you, saying, 'Come here that I may send you to the king to say, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I <transChange type="added">were</transChange> still there." ' So then, let me see the face of the king; if there <transChange type="added">is</transChange> guilt in me, then let him kill me."</verse>
    <verse num="33">So Joab went to the king and he told him. Then he summoned Absalom, and he came to the king, and he bowed down to him with his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="15">
    <verse num="1">It happened afterward that Absalom made himself a chariot with horses and fifty men running before him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Absalom used to rise early in the morning, and he stood {beside}<note>Literally "on hand of"</note> the road <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the gate; {anyone}<note>Literally "every man"</note> who had a legal dispute to bring to the king for judgment Absalom would call to him and say, "{Where are you from?}"<note>Literally "Where from this city are you?"</note> And he would say, "Your servant <transChange type="added">is</transChange> from one of the tribes of Israel."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Absalom would say to him, "Look, your case <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good and right, but for you there is no hearing with the king."</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Absalom would say, "{Oh, that someone would}<note>Literally "Who will ...?"</note> appoint me as judge in the land, that {anyone}<note>Literally "every man"</note> might come to me who had a legal dispute or a case, and I would give him justice."</verse>
    <verse num="5">It happened whenever anyone drew near to do obeisance to him, that he would stretch his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Absalom did like this to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts<note>Hebrew "heart"</note> of the people of Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="7">It happened at the end of four<note>So LXX, followed by Syriac and Vulgate; MT has "forty"</note> years <transChange type="added">that</transChange> Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to Yahweh in Hebron,</verse>
    <verse num="8">for your servant made a vow while I <transChange type="added">was</transChange> staying in Geshur in Aram, saying, '{If Yahweh will indeed let me return}<note>Literally (following Qere) "If returning Yahweh will return me"</note> to Jerusalem, then I will worship Yahweh.'"</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then the king said to him, "Go in peace." So he got up and went to Hebron.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Absalom sent scouts throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "When you hear the sound of the trumpet, you shall shout 'Absalom has become king in Hebron!'"</verse>
    <verse num="11">Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom as invited guests, going in their innocence as they did not know anything.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, the advisor of David, from his city Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. The conspiracy {grew in strength},<note>Literally "became strong"</note> and the people <transChange type="added">were</transChange> going and {increasing}<note>Literally "many"</note> with Absalom. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then the messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts<note>Hebrew "heart"</note> of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then David said to all his servants who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him in Jerusalem, "Get up and let us flee, for there will be no escape for us from Absalom! Hurry to go, otherwise he will come quickly and overtake us! And he will bring disaster on us and evil! He will attack the city with the edge of the sword!"</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then the servants of the king said to the king, "According to all that my lord the king chooses, {your servants are ready to act}!"<note>Literally "here are your servants"</note></verse>
    <verse num="16">The king went out with<note>Hebrew "and"</note> all his household {following him},<note>Literally "at his feet"</note> but the king left behind ten concubines to look after the house.</verse>
    <verse num="17">So the king went out with<note>Hebrew "and"</note> all the people {following him},<note>Literally "at his feet"</note> and they stopped {at the last house}.<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">at</transChange> the house of the distance"</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">All his servants <transChange type="added">were</transChange> passing {by him}:<note>Literally "on his hand"</note> all of the Kerethites and all of the Pelethites and all of the Gittites--six hundred men {who had followed him}<note>Literally "who had come at his feet"</note> from Gath--passing {before the king}.<note>Literally "on the face of the king"</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">The king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you also coming with us? Return and stay with the king, for you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> a foreigner; moreover, you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> an exile. {You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> far from your place}.<note>Literally "You as far as your place"</note></verse>
    <verse num="20">Yesterday when you came and {today},<note>Literally "the day"</note> I have caused you to wander by going with us. Now I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> going to where I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> going; return and let your brothers return. <transChange type="added">May</transChange> loyal love and faithfulness <transChange type="added">be</transChange> with you."</verse>
    <verse num="21">But Ittai answered the king and said, "{As Yahweh lives}<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> and {my lord the king lives},<note>Literally "the life of my lord the king"</note> surely in the place wherever my lord the king shall be, if for death or if for life, surely there your servant will be."</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then David said to Ittai, "Go and pass over." So Ittai the Gittite passed over and all his men and all of the little children who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="23">All of the land <transChange type="added">was</transChange> weeping <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a loud voice as all the people <transChange type="added">were</transChange> passing by and the king <transChange type="added">was</transChange> crossing through the Wadi Kidron, and all the people <transChange type="added">were</transChange> passing {on the road to the wilderness}.<note>Literally "on the face of the road with the wilderness"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="24">Suddenly Zadok <transChange type="added">was</transChange> there, and all of the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set the ark of God down, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people passed out of the city.</verse>
    <verse num="25">The king said to Zadok, "Let the ark of God return to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yawheh, he will let me return and let me see him in his dwelling place.</verse>
    <verse num="26">But if he says, 'I take no pleasure in you,' then {I am ready}.<note>Literally "here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>"</note> Let him do to me that which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good in his eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then the king said to Zadok the priest, "<transChange type="added">Are</transChange> you a seer? Return to the city in peace, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.</verse>
    <verse num="28">See, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> waiting at the fords of the wilderness until a word comes from you all to inform me."</verse>
    <verse num="29">So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and they remained there. </verse>
    <verse num="30">Now David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> going up on the Ascent of the Olives, {weeping as he went},<note>Literally "going up and weeping"</note> with his head covered and going barefoot. All the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him each covered their head {and wept as they went}.<note>Literally "going up and weeping"</note></verse>
    <verse num="31">Now David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> told, "Ahithophel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> among the conspirators with Absalom." Then David said, "Please frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel, O Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="32">It happened that as David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> coming up to the summit where he used to worship God, suddenly Hushai the Arkite <transChange type="added">was</transChange> there to meet him. His coat <transChange type="added">was</transChange> torn and dirt <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on his head.</verse>
    <verse num="33">David said to him, "If you move on with me, you will be a burden to me,</verse>
    <verse num="34">but if you want to return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> your servant, O king. I used to be a servant of your father, but from then and now I <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> your servant,' then you can frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel for me.</verse>
    <verse num="35"><transChange type="added">Will</transChange> not Zadok and Abiathar the priests <transChange type="added">be</transChange> with you there? It shall be that all the words you hear from the house of the king you shall tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Look, there with them <transChange type="added">are</transChange> their two sons, Ahimaaz of Zadok and Jonathan of Abiathar. You shall send to me {by means of them}<note>Literally "by their hand"</note> all the words that you hear."</verse>
    <verse num="37">So Hushai the friend of David came to the city <transChange type="added">as</transChange> Absalom was entering Jerusalem. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="16">
    <verse num="1">Now David passed a little from beyond the summit, and suddenly Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth <transChange type="added">was</transChange> there to meet him <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a pair of saddled donkeys; on them <transChange type="added">were</transChange> two hundred loaves of bread and a hundred raisin cakes, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The king said to Ziba, "{What do you want to accomplish by bringing these}?"<note>Literally "What are these to you?"</note> And Ziba said, "The donkeys <transChange type="added">are</transChange> for the king's household to ride <transChange type="added">on</transChange>; the bread and the summer fruit <transChange type="added">are</transChange> for the young men to eat, and the wine <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for the faint in the wilderness to drink.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then the king said, "Where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the son of your lord?" And Ziba said to the king, "He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> living in Jerusalem for he said, 'Today the house of Israel shall return the kingdom of my father to me.'"</verse>
    <verse num="4">The king said to Ziba, "Look, all that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Mephibosheth's is yours." Ziba said, "I hereby do obeisance; may I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king." </verse>
    <verse num="5">King David came up to Bahurim and suddenly a man from there <transChange type="added">was</transChange> coming out from the family of the house of Saul, and his name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Shimei the son of Gera. {He was cursing as he came out}.<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">He was</transChange> coming out, coming out and cursing"</note></verse>
    <verse num="6">And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David and at all the people and at all the mighty warriors on his right and on his left.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Shimei said while cursing him, "Go out, go out, <transChange type="added">you</transChange> {man of bloodshed},<note>Literally "man of bloods"</note> <transChange type="added">you</transChange> {man of wickedness}.<note>Literally "and man of the wickedness"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the household of Saul {whom you have supplanted as king},<note>Literally "who you have reigned in place of him"</note> and Yahweh has given the kingship into the hand of Absalom your son. Look, you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in disaster for you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> a man of blood."</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head."</verse>
    <verse num="10">The king said, "{What do we have in common},<note>Literally "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for me and what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for you"</note> sons of Zeruiah? If<note>Hebrew "Because"</note> he curses because Yahweh has said to him 'Curse David,' who can say, "Why have you done this?"</verse>
    <verse num="11">David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Look, my son who came out of my loins<note>Hebrew "intestines"</note> <transChange type="added">is</transChange> seeking my life. Now {as far as}<note>Literally "and even that now"</note> <transChange type="added">this</transChange> Benjaminite, leave him alone and let him curse, for Yahweh has spoken to him.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Perhaps Yahweh will look {in my eye}<note>According to the reading tradition (Qere); Kethib has "at my guilt"</note> and repay good for me in place of his curse this day.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then David and his men went on the road, with Shimei going on the side of the hill beside him, {cursing as he went}.<note>Literally "going and cursing"</note> He threw stones beside him and threw<note>Hebrew "flung"</note> dust in the air.</verse>
    <verse num="14">When the king and all of the people who were with him arrived, he was weary, so he recovered there. </verse>
    <verse num="15">Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, had come to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="16">When Hushai the Arkite the friend of David came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, "<transChange type="added">Long</transChange> live the king, <transChange type="added">long</transChange> live the king!"</verse>

    <verse num="18">Then Hushai said to Absalom, "No, rather, whom Yahweh and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, to him<note>According to the reading tradition (Qere); Kethib has "no"</note> I will be, and with him I will remain.</verse>
    <verse num="19">{Furthermore},<note>Literally "And the second <transChange type="added">thing</transChange>"</note> for whom have I served? <transChange type="added">Is</transChange> it not in the presence of his son that I have served before your father? {So shall I serve you}!"<note>Literally "So shall I be in your presence"</note></verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give your advice. What shall we do?"</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go to the concubines of your father whom he left behind to watch over the house, then all of Israel will hear that you made yourself odious to your father, and {all of your followers will be motivated}!"<note>Literally "the hands of all who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> with you will be strengthened"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">Then they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he went <transChange type="added">in</transChange> to the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="23">The counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days <transChange type="added">was</transChange> regarded as when a man<note>Qere reads "a man inquired"; Kethib omits "a man"</note> inquired of the word of God, so all the counsel of Ahithophel <transChange type="added">was esteemed</transChange> both by David and by Absalom. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="17">
    <verse num="1">Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Please let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out and pursue after David {tonight}.<note>Literally "the night"</note></verse>

    <verse num="3">Then I will return all the people to you; when all have returned, the man whom you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> seeking <transChange type="added">will be dead</transChange>,<note>According to the MT; the LXX has "and I will return all the people to you the way a bride returns to her husband, except the life of the one man whom you are seeking"</note> but all the people will be safe."</verse>
    <verse num="4">The word <transChange type="added">was</transChange> right in the eyes of Absalom and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.</verse>

    <verse num="6">So Hushai came to Absalom, who said to him, "Shall we do according to this word <transChange type="added">that</transChange> Ahithophel has spoken? If not, then you tell <transChange type="added">us</transChange>."</verse>

    <verse num="9">Now he has hidden himself in one of the caves or in one of the places.

    <verse num="11">I give the advice that all of Israel from Dan to Beersheba should be completely gathered to you, as the sand which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on the seashore for abundance, with {you personally}<note>Literally "your face"</note> going into the battle.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then we will come to him in one of the places where he may be found, and we shall come upon him as the dew falls on the ground. He and all the men who are with him will not survive, <transChange type="added">not</transChange> even one!</verse>

    <verse num="15">Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, "{Thus and so}<note>Literally "so this and so this"</note> Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, but {thus and so}<note>Literally "so this and so this"</note> I have advised.</verse>
    <verse num="16">So then, send quickly and tell David, 'Don't spend the night at the fords of the wilderness! Moreover, by all means cross over lest the king and all the people who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> with him be swallowed up.'"</verse>
    <verse num="17">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz <transChange type="added">were</transChange> staying at En Rogel, so a servant girl used to go and tell them, then they would go and tell King David, for they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not able to be seen coming to the city.</verse>
    <verse num="18">But a young man saw them and told Absalom, so both of them went quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim. Now he had a well in his courtyard, so they went down there.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then the woman took and spread a covering over the opening of the well; then she spread out dried grain on it, so nothing was discovered.</verse>
    <verse num="20">When the servants of Absalom came to the woman <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the house, they said, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" And she said to them, "They crossed over the brook of water." So they searched but could not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="21">After they left, they came up from the well and went and told King David. They said to David, "Set out and cross over the water quickly, for thus Ahithophel has advised against you."</verse>
    <verse num="22">So David and all the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him set out, and they crossed over the Jordan until morning light until {there was no one}<note>Literally "until one <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not missing"</note> missing who had not crossed over the Jordan.</verse>
    <verse num="23">When Ahithophel saw that his advice <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not followed, he saddled the donkey, and he set out and went up to his house in his city. {After he set his house in order},<note>Literally "And he commanded to his household"</note> he hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="24">Now David had come to Mahanaim, and Absalom had crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Absalom had appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Now Amasa <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the son of a man whose name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Ithra the Israelite, {who had married}<note>Literally "who went to"</note> Abigail the daughter of Nahash the sister of Zeruiah, the mother of Joab.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Israel and Absalom camped <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the land of Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Just as David had arrived in Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the {Ammonites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> and Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim</verse>
    <verse num="28">brought beds and basins and objects of pottery, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,</verse>
    <verse num="29">honey, curds, sheep, cheese, and cattle for David and for the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him to eat. For they had thought, "The troops <transChange type="added">are</transChange> hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="18">
    <verse num="1">Then David mustered the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, and he appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.</verse>
    <verse num="2">David sent forth a third of the troops {under the command of Joab},<note>Literally "in the hand of Joab"</note> and a third {under the command of Abishai},<note>Literally "in the hand of Abishai"</note> the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the remaining third {under the command of Ittai}<note>Literally "in the hand of Ittai"</note> the Gittite. And the king said to the troops, "I, even I, {will certainly go out}<note>Literally "going out I will go out"</note> with you."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then the troops said, "You will not go out, for {if we must flee},<note>Literally "fleeing we must flee"</note> then {they will not care about us};<note>Literally "they will not set heart toward us"</note> even if half of us die, {they will not care about us},<note>Literally "they will not set heart toward us"</note> but now, you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> like ten thousand of us. And so then, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> better for us that you be in the city to help."</verse>
    <verse num="4">The king said to them, "I will do what seems good in your eyes." So the king stood at the side of the gate <transChange type="added">while</transChange> all of the troops went out by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
    <verse num="5">The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, "With respect to the young man Absalom, <transChange type="added">deal</transChange> gently for me." And all the troops heard when the king ordered all of the commanders concerning the matter of Absalom. </verse>
    <verse num="6">The army went out to the field to meet Israel, and the battle was <transChange type="added">fought</transChange> in the forest of Ephraim.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The army of Israel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> defeated there before the servants of David, and the defeat there was great on that day: twenty thousand.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The battle there was spreading over the surface of all the land, and {the forest devoured more among the army than}<note>Literally "the forest made numerous to eat among the army more than"</note> the sword <transChange type="added">did</transChange> on that day.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Absalom was found in the presence of the servants of David <transChange type="added">as he was</transChange> riding on the mule. The mule went under the thicket of the great oak tree, and his head <transChange type="added">was</transChange> caught in the tree. He <transChange type="added">was</transChange> left hanging between heaven and earth, and the mule which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> under him went on.</verse>
    <verse num="10">When a certain man saw <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, he told Joab, and he said, "Look, I saw Absalom hanging in the oak tree!"</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Joab said to the man who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> telling him, "Look, <transChange type="added">if</transChange> you saw, why did you not strike him down to the ground there? {I would have gladly given you}<note>Literally "And upon me to give to you"</note> ten pieces of silver and a leather belt."</verse>
    <verse num="12">The man said to Joab, "{Even if I felt the weight}<note>Literally "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> not weighing out on my palms"</note> of a thousand pieces of silver in my palms, I would not have sent my hand against the son of the king, for in our ears the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, 'Whoever you may be, protect the young man Absalom.'</verse>
    <verse num="13">If I had dealt treacherously against his life, and <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> not any matter hidden from the king, {you would have presented yourself aloof}."<note>Literally "you would have presented yourself from before"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">Joab said, "No longer will I wait in your presence." Then he took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> still alive in the oak tree.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then ten of the young men who bore the weapons of Joab surrounded <transChange type="added">him</transChange> and struck and killed Absalom.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Joab blew on the trumpet and the troops returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab kept back the troops.</verse>
    <verse num="17">They took Absalom and they threw him into the large pit in the forest and raised a very great heap of stones over him. Then all of Israel fled, each to his tent. </verse>
    <verse num="18">(Now Absalom had taken and set up for himself in his lifetime a stone pillar that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the valley of the king, because he said, "I have no son in order to remember my name," and he called the stone pillar by his name. It <transChange type="added">is</transChange> called the monument of Absalom until this day).</verse>
    <verse num="19">Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, "Please let me run and bring the good news to the king that Yahweh has vindicated him from the hand of his enemies."</verse>
    <verse num="20">Joab said to him, "You <transChange type="added">will</transChange> not <transChange type="added">be</transChange> a man {bringing}<note>Literally "for upon"</note> good news this day! You may bring good news on another day, but today you will not be bringing good news because the king's son is dead."</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Joab said to the Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen"; then the Cushite bowed down to Joab and ran <transChange type="added">off</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again said to Joab, "{Come what may},<note>Literally "And let it happen what"</note> please let me also run after the Cushite." Joab asked, "Why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you wanting to run, my son, when for you there is no {messenger's reward}?"<note>Literally "and for you there is no good news finding"</note></verse>
    <verse num="23">"{Come what may},<note>Literally "And let it happen what"</note> I want to run." He said to him, "Run," so Ahimaaz ran on the road on the plain, and he passed the Cushite. </verse>
    <verse num="24">Now David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sitting between the two gates, and the sentinel went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and he lifted up his eyes and watched, and look, a man <transChange type="added">was</transChange> running by himself.</verse>
    <verse num="25">The sentry called and told the king, and the king said, "If he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> alone, good news is in his mouth." {He kept coming closer}.<note>Literally "And he came, coming and near"</note></verse>
    <verse num="26">Then the sentinel saw another man running, so the sentinel called to the gatekeeper and said, "Look, a man running alone." The king said, "This one also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> bringing good news."</verse>
    <verse num="27">The sentinel said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> seeing <transChange type="added">that</transChange> the running of the first <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zakok." The king said, "He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a good man; he will come, for good news."</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then Ahimaaz called and said to the king, "Peace." He bowed down to the king with his face to the ground, and he said, "May Yahweh your God be blessed, who has delivered the men who raised their hand against my lord the king."</verse>
    <verse num="29">The king said, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> it peace for the young man Absalom?" Ahimaaz said, "I saw the great commotion when Joab the servant of the king sent your servant, but I do not know what <transChange type="added">it was all about</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then the king said, "Turn aside, take your place here," so he turned aside and waited.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Suddenly the Cushite arrived and said, "May my lord the king receive the good news, for Yahweh has vindicated you today from the power of all who stood up against you."</verse>
    <verse num="32">The king said to the Cushite, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> it peace for the young man Absalom?" Then the Cushite answered, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you {to harm you}<note>Literally "for evil"</note> be like the young man!"</verse>
    <verse num="33"><note>2 Samuel 18:33-19:43 in the English Bible is 19:1-44 in the Hebrew Bible</note> The king was upset, and he went up to the upper room of the gate and wept. He said as he went, "My son, Absalom, my son, my son, Absalom. {If only}<note>Literally "Who would grant my dying in place of you"</note> I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">And it was told to Joab that the king <transChange type="added">was</transChange> weeping and he mourned over Absalom,</verse>
    <verse num="2">so the victory turned to mourning on that day for all the army, because they had heard that day, "The king is grieving over his son."</verse>
    <verse num="3">The army {came secretly}<note>Literally "stole secretly to come"</note> into the city on that day because the army was disgraced when they fled in the battle,</verse>
    <verse num="4">and because the king had covered his face and cried with a loud voice, "My son, Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son." </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Joab came to the king's house and said, "Today you have humiliated the faces of all of your servants who have saved your life this day, and the life of your sons and your daughters, the life of your wives, and the life of your concubines,</verse>
    <verse num="6">by loving those who hate you and hating those who love you. Indeed, you have made clear this day that you have no <transChange type="added">regard for your</transChange> commanders or officers, for I have realized today that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> Absalom alive, and all of us were dead, then <transChange type="added">that would</transChange> have been right in your eyes!</verse>
    <verse num="7">So then, get up and go out and {speak kindly to your servants},<note>Literally "speak to the heart of your servants"</note> for I swear by Yahweh, if you do not go out, no man will lodge this night with you, and this disaster <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> greater for you than any disaster that has come upon you from your childhood until now!"</verse>
    <verse num="8">So the king got up and he sat in the gate, and they told all the army, "Look, the king <transChange type="added">is</transChange> sitting in the gate." Then all the army came before the king; <transChange type="added">whereas</transChange> all of Israel had fled, each to his tent. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Then it happened that all the people <transChange type="added">were</transChange> disputing among all the tribes of Israel, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and he saved us from the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now Absalom whom we anointed <transChange type="added">as king</transChange> over us has died in the battle; so then, why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you taking no action to restore the king?"</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, "Speak to the elders of Judah: 'Why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you last to bring back the king to his house? The talk of all Israel has come to the king in his house.</verse>
    <verse num="12">My brothers, you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> my bones and you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> my flesh. Why should you be the last to bring back the king?'</verse>
    <verse num="13">To Amasa you shall say: '<transChange type="added">Are</transChange> you not my bones and my flesh? {May God punish me}<note>Literally "Thus may God do to me and thus may he add"</note> if you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> not the commander of my army before me forever, in place of Joab.'"</verse>
    <verse num="14">So he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, and they sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to the king, "Return, you and all your servants." </verse>
    <verse num="15">Then the king returned and he came to the Jordan; Judah had come to Gilgal to come to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Shimei the son of Gera, the son of the Benjaminite, who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> from Bahurim quickly came down with the men of Judah to meet King David,</verse>
    <verse num="17">and a thousand men <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him from Benjamin. Too, Ziba the servant of the household of Saul and fifteen of his sons and twenty of his servants <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, and they rushed to the Jordan before the king.</verse>
    <verse num="18">{The crossing took place}<note>Literally "And the ford crossed"</note> to bring the household of the king over and to do good in his eyes. Then Shimei the son of Gera fell before the king when he crossed over the Jordan,</verse>
    <verse num="19">and he said to the king, "May not my lord hold me guilty, and may you not remember how your servant did wrong on the day that my lord the king went out from Jerusalem, by taking it to heart!</verse>
    <verse num="20">For your servant knows that I have sinned; look, I have come this day <transChange type="added">as the first</transChange> of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king."</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah responded and said, "Because of this, should not Shimei be put to death, for he cursed the anointed one of Yahweh?"</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then David said, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> it to me or to you, sons of Zeruiah, that you should be an adversary today? <transChange type="added">Should</transChange> anyone be put to death in Israel? Do I not know today that I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> king over Israel?"</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die," and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> the king swore to him. </verse>
    <verse num="24">Now, Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; he had not taken care of his feet nor trimmed his moustache nor washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came back in peace.</verse>
    <verse num="25">It happened that when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, "Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?"</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then he said, "My lord the king, my servant deceived me, for your servant had said, 'Let me saddle the donkey that I may ride on her and go with the king,' for your servant <transChange type="added">is</transChange> lame.</verse>
    <verse num="27">But he slandered against your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like the angel of God; {do as you see fit.}."<note>Literally "do the good in your eyes"</note></verse>
    <verse num="28">For there <transChange type="added">was no one</transChange> in all the house of my father {who were not doomed to death}<note>Literally "except men of death"</note> before my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. Do I have any righteousness any longer except to cry out to the king?"</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then the king said to him, "Why should you speak any more <transChange type="added">about</transChange> the matter? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land."</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him take the whole <transChange type="added">thing</transChange>, since my lord the king has come {safely}<note>Literally "in peace"</note> to his house." </verse>
    <verse num="31">Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and crossed with the king over the Jordan to escort him through the Jordan.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Now Barzillai <transChange type="added">was</transChange> very old, {eighty years old}.<note>Literally "a son of eighty years"</note> Now he had provided the king <transChange type="added">with food</transChange> while he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> staying at Mahanaim, for he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a very wealthy man.</verse>
    <verse num="33">The king said to Barzillai, "You cross over with me, and I will provide for you <transChange type="added">to dwell</transChange> with me in Jerusalem."</verse>
    <verse num="34">Then Barzillai said to the king, "What <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the days of the years of my life, that I should go with the king to Jerusalem?</verse>
    <verse num="35">I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> eighty years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be a burden any longer to my lord the king?</verse>
    <verse num="36">Your servant shall go over the Jordan with the king a little way, but why should the king recompense me with this reward?</verse>
    <verse num="37">Please let your servant return, and let me die in my city in the tomb of my father and my mother. Here <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your servant Kimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him that which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good in your eyes."</verse>
    <verse num="38">The king said, "Let Kimham go over with me, and I will do for him the good in your eyes, and all that you desire of me I will do for you." </verse>
    <verse num="39">Then all the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king crossed and kissed Barzillai and blessed him; then he returned to his place.</verse>
    <verse num="40">The king went over to Gilgal, and Kimham went over with him. All the people of Judah went over with the king, and half of the people of Israel too.</verse>
    <verse num="41">Suddenly, all the men of Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> coming to the king. They said to the king, "Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, with all the men of David?"</verse>
    <verse num="42">Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "Because the king <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my close relative! Why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you this angry over this matter? {Have we by any means eaten <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> from the king? Did we take by any means anything that was not ours}?"<note>Literally "By any means did we eat from the king or by any means was it dragged away for us?"</note></verse>
    <verse num="43">Then the people of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, "I have {ten times as much}<note>Literally "ten hands"</note> in the king, moreover in David I have more than you. Why did you treat me with contempt {by not giving me first chance}<note>Literally "and my word <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not the first"</note> to bring back my king?" But the words of the men of Judah <transChange type="added">were</transChange> fiercer than the word of the men of Israel. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">Now a man of wickedness was found there whose name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. He blew the horn and said, "There is no share for us in David, and there <transChange type="added">is</transChange> no inheritance for us in the son of Jesse; each to his tents, O Israel!"</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then all the men of Israel went up from <transChange type="added">following</transChange> after David, <transChange type="added">following instead</transChange> after Sheba the son of Bicri, but the men of Judah stuck to their king from the Jordan up to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="3">David went up to his house in Jerusalem, then the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to look after the house, and he put them {under confinement}.<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">a</transChange> house of guard"</note> However, he provided for them, but {he did not sleep with them}.<note>Literally "he did not come into them"</note> So they were confined until the day of their death, like a lifetime of widowhood. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the king said to Amasa, "Summon for me the men of Judah <transChange type="added">within</transChange> three days, {and be here yourself}."<note>Literally "and you stand here"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he tarried more than the appointed time which he had set for him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba the son of Bicri will do us more harm than Absalom. You take the servants of your lord and pursue after him, lest he find fortified cities for himself and escape from us."</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then the men of Joab, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty warriors went out after him; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri.</verse>
    <verse num="8">They <transChange type="added">were</transChange> near the big rock that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Gibeon, and Amasa came before them. Joab {was dressed in his military clothing},<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">was</transChange> dressed his garment his clothing"</note> <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a utility belt on him and a sword strapped to his waist in its scabbard. Now he went out, and it fell out.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Joab said to Amasa, "Is it peace, O you my brother?" Then the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amasa <transChange type="added">as if</transChange> to kiss him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now Amasa was not on his guard against the sword that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Joab's hand, and he struck him with it into the stomach, and his entrails poured out to the ground. He did not strike him again, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bicri.</verse>
    <verse num="11">A young man stood over him, from the young men of Joab, and he said, "Whoever takes delight in Joab and whoever <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for David, <transChange type="added">follow</transChange> after Joab."</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now Amasa <transChange type="added">was</transChange> wallowing in the blood in the middle of the highway; when the man saw that all the people stood <transChange type="added">there</transChange>, he turned Amasa over from the highway into the field, and he threw a garment over him because he had seen that all who had come by him had stopped.</verse>
    <verse num="13">After he was removed from the highway, all the men passed by after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri. </verse>
    <verse num="14">(He<note>i.e., "Sheba"</note> had passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maacah; now all of the Berites had been treated badly, so they also followed after him.)</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they came and besieged him in Abel Beth Maacah. They threw up a siege ramp against the city, and they stood against the ramparts.

    <verse num="16">Then a wise woman from the city called out, "Listen, listen! Please speak to Joab <transChange type="added">to</transChange> come near here so that I may speak to you."</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then he came near to her, and the woman asked, "<transChange type="added">Are</transChange> you Joab?" And he said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>." Then she said to him, "Listen to the words of your servant." He said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> listening."</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then she said, "In former times, {they would always say},<note>Literally "speaking they would speak"</note> 'By all means, let them inquire in Abel,' and so they settled things.</verse>
    <verse num="19">I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> one of the faithful representatives of Israel. You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> seeking to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow the inheritance of Yahweh?"</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Joab answered and said, "Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow or I should destroy.</verse>
    <verse num="21">That is not the matter. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Sheba the son Bicri, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Give only him to us, and I will depart from the city." The woman said to Joab, "Look, his head <transChange type="added">is</transChange> being thrown down to you over the wall."</verse>
    <verse num="22">The woman went to all of the people with her wise plan, so they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bicri and threw <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to Joab. Then he blew the horn and dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Now Joab <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over all the army of Israel and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the Carites and over the Pelethites.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Adoram <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the recorder.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Shiya <transChange type="added">was</transChange> secretary, and Zadok and Abiathar <transChange type="added">were</transChange> priests.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Also Ira the Jairite <transChange type="added">was</transChange> priest for David. </verse>

  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">There <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a famine in the days of David <transChange type="added">for</transChange> three years, year after year. And David {inquired of Yahweh},<note>Literally "sought the face of Yahweh"</note> and Yahweh said, "The bloodguilt <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on Saul and on his household, because he killed the Gibeonites."</verse>
    <verse num="2">So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not from the {Israelites};<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> from the remainder of the Amorites. Now the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> had sworn to them,<note>The treaty between Israel and the Gibeonites is found in Josh 9</note> but Saul tried to wipe them out in his zeal for the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> and Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="3">So David asked the Gibeonites, "What can I do for you, and with what can I make amends that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?"</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the Gibeonites said to him, "{It is not a matter for us of}<note>Literally "There is not for me (Qere 'us')"</note> silver or gold with Saul or with his household. It is not for us to put to death anyone in Israel." He asked, "What <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you saying <transChange type="added">that</transChange> I should do for you all?"</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then they said to the king, "The man who consumed us and who plotted against us <transChange type="added">so that</transChange> we were destroyed from existing in all of the territory of Israel,</verse>
    <verse num="6">let seven men from his sons be given over to us, and we will execute them before Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen one of Yahweh." Then the king said, "I will give them over."</verse>
    <verse num="7">But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the sworn oath of Yahweh which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So the king took two of the sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, namely Armoni and Mephibosheth, and five of the sons of Michal the daughter of Saul whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they executed them on the mountain in the presence of Yahweh, and the seven fell together. Now they were put to death in the days of the harvest, at the beginning of the harvest of barley. </verse>
    <verse num="10">Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took the sackcloth, and she spread it for herself on the rock at the beginning of the harvest until water gushed forth on them from heaven, but she did not allow the birds of heaven to rest on them by day nor the animals of the field by night.</verse>
    <verse num="11">David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> told about what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So David left and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the rulers of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth Shan, where <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines hung them {when}<note>Literally "on the day"</note> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of the executed.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin at Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. They did all that the king had commanded, and afterward God was entreated for the land. </verse>
    <verse num="15">There <transChange type="added">was</transChange> war again for <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines with Israel, and David and his servants with him went down, and they fought <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, and David grew weary.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Now Yishbi in Nob, who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> among the descendents of Raphah<note>The descendants of Raphah (i.e., the Rephaim) <transChange type="added">were</transChange> thought to be giants</note> (now the weight of his spearhead <transChange type="added">was</transChange> three hundredweight of bronze, and he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> newly armed), said that he would kill David.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and he attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, "You shall not go out with us any longer to the battle, so that you do not quench the lamp of Israel." </verse>
    <verse num="18">It happened afterward that there <transChange type="added">was</transChange> again battle at Gob with <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> among the descendants of the Raphah. </verse>
    <verse num="19">There <transChange type="added">was</transChange> again a battle with <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines at Gob. And Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim, the Bethlehemite, killed Goliath<note>In view of the account of David and Goliath in 1 Sam 17, it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> likely that Elhanan actually killed the brother of Goliath, Lahmi, in 1 Chr 20:5</note> the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear <transChange type="added">was</transChange> like the beam of a weaver. </verse>
    <verse num="20">Once again there <transChange type="added">was</transChange> battle at Gath, and there <transChange type="added">was</transChange> {a man of great size}.<note>Literally "a man of measurement"</note> The fingers of his hand and the toes of his feet <transChange type="added">were</transChange> six and six, twenty-four in number.

    <verse num="21">He taunted Israel but Jonathan the son of Shimei, the brother of David, killed him.</verse>
    <verse num="22">These four <transChange type="added">were</transChange> born for the Raphah in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. </verse>

  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">Then David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song,<note>This same song is recorded in Psa 18, with minor differences</note> on the day Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. </verse>

    <verse num="11">He rode upon a cherub and flew; he was seen on the wings of the wind.</verse>
    <verse num="12">He put darkness <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a canopy all around him, a collection of {thick rain clouds}.<note>Literally "clouds of thick clouds"</note></verse>

    <verse num="1">Again Yahweh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> angry with Israel, and he<note>The parallel passage in 1 Chr 21 names the "he" as Satan</note> incited David against them, saying, "Go count Israel and Judah."</verse>
    <verse num="2">The king said to Joab, the commander of the army who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him: "Please go about through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people that I may know the number of the people."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Joab said to the king, "May Yahweh your God increase the people a hundred times {what they are}<note>Literally "as them and as them"</note> as the eyes of my lord the king are seeing. But my lord the king, why does he desire this thing?"</verse>
    <verse num="4">But the word of the king prevailed over Joab and over the commanders of the army, so Joab and the commanders of the army went out from before the king to count the people of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="5">They crossed over the Jordan and camped at Aroer to the south of the city, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the middle of the wadi of Gad, and up to Jazer.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then they went to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi. They came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon</verse>
    <verse num="7">and came to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to the Negev of Judah at Beersheba.</verse>
    <verse num="8">They went about through all the land, and they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Joab gave the number of the counting of the people to the king. Israel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> eight hundred thousand {valiant warriors}<note>Literally "men of ability"</note> wielding the sword, and the men of Judah <transChange type="added">were</transChange> five hundred thousand.</verse>
    <verse num="10">The heart of David struck him after he had counted the people, and David said to Yahweh, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done! So then, O Yahweh, please forgive the guilt of your servant because I have acted very foolishly."</verse>
    <verse num="11">When David got up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came to Gad the prophet, the seer of David, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="12">"Go and speak to David, 'Thus says Yahweh, three things I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> laying on you; choose for yourself one of them and I will do it to you.'"</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Gad came to David, and he told him and said to him, "Shall seven years of famine in the land come to you?

Now consider and decide what I must return to the one who sent me a word."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then David said to Gad, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> greatly distressed. Please let us fall into the hand of Yahweh, because he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> great in his compassion; but into the hand of man don't let me fall."</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Yahweh sent a plague into Israel from the morning {until the agreed time},<note>Literally "until the time of agreed time"</note> and from the people from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand men died. </verse>
    <verse num="16">When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, Yahweh regretted about the evil, and he said to the angel who brought destruction among the people, "Enough, now relax your hand." Now the angel of Yahweh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
    <verse num="17">David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel destroying among the people, and he said, "Look, I have sinned and I have done wrong, but these sheep, what did they do? Please let your hand be against me and against the house of my father."</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Gad came to David on that same day and said to him, "Go up and erect an altar to Yahweh at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."</verse>
    <verse num="19">So David went up according to the word of Gad, as Yahweh had commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants coming over to him, so Araunah went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David said, "To buy from you the threshing floor, to build an altar to Yahweh who brought a halt to the plague on the people."</verse>
    <verse num="22">Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good in his eyes. Look, here <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the cattle for the burnt offering and the threshing sledge and the yokes of the oxen for the firewood.</verse>
    <verse num="23">All of this Araunah hereby gives to the king." Then Araunah said to the king, "May Yahweh your God respond favorably for you."</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then the king said to Araunah, "No, but {I will certainly buy}<note>Literally "buying I will buy"</note> it from you for a price; I don't want to offer to Yahweh my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
    <verse num="25">David built an altar to Yahweh there, and he offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then Yahweh responded to <transChange type="added">his</transChange> prayer for the land and brought the plague to a halt from upon Israel. </verse>
