  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself concerning his kingdom, and Yahweh his God <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him and made him exceedingly great.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the leaders for all Israel, the heads of the {families}.<note>Literally "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">And Solomon and the whole assembly with him went to the high place that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> at Gibeon, for the tent of assembly<note>Or "meeting"</note> of God that Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the desert was there.</verse>
    <verse num="4">(But the ark of God David had brought up from Kiriath-Jearim to <transChange type="added">the place</transChange> David had prepared for it, for David had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.)</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made <transChange type="added">was</transChange> there before the tabernacle of Yahweh. And Solomon and the assembly sought it out.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> at the tent of assembly,<note>Or "meeting"</note> and he offered upon it a thousand burnt offerings. </verse>
    <verse num="7">On that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask what I shall give to you."</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then Solomon said to God, "You yourself have shown steadfast<note>Or "great"</note> loyal love to David my father and have made me king in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Now, O Yahweh God, let your word to David my father be fulfilled, for you yourself have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now, give to me wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can judge this, your great people?" </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then God said to Solomon, "Because this was with your heart and you did not ask for wealth, possessions, honor, and the lives of your enemies, and also did not ask for {long life},<note>Literally "many days"</note> but have asked for wisdom and knowledge that you might judge my people over whom I have made you king,</verse>
    <verse num="12">wisdom and knowledge is given to you. And I will <transChange type="added">also</transChange> give to you wealth, possessions, and honor, the like of which was not had by the kings who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> before you, nor will there be the like after you."</verse>
    <verse num="13">So Solomon went from the high place which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> at Gibeon <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem before the tent of assembly.<note>Or "meeting"</note> And he reigned over Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="14">And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. And he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem like the stones. And he made cedar as abundant as the sycamore fig trees that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the Shephelah.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Solomon's horses <transChange type="added">were</transChange> imported from Egypt and from Kue. The traders of the king received <transChange type="added">them</transChange> from Kue at a price.</verse>
    <verse num="17">They went up and exported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for one hundred and fifty <transChange type="added">shekels</transChange>. And <transChange type="added">these were</transChange> {likewise exported}<note>Literally "likewise through their hand"</note> to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.<note>Or "Syria"</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1"><note>2 Chronicles 2:1-18 in the English Bible is 1:18-2:17 in the Hebrew Bible</note> And Solomon planned to build a house for the name of Yahweh and a {royal palace for himself}.<note>Literally "house for his kingdom"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">And Solomon assigned seventy thousand men {to bear burdens}<note>Literally "carriers"</note> and eighty thousand {quarriers}<note>Literally "stone craftsmen"</note> in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred <transChange type="added">men</transChange> to supervise them.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Solomon sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to Huram<note>This is the spelling in Hebrew, though many translations have "Hiram"</note> king of Tyre, saying, "As you have dealt with David my father and sent cedar to him to build for himself a house in which to live, <transChange type="added">please deal with me</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Look, I am building a house for the name of Yahweh my God to dedicate to him, to offer sweet spices of incense before him, and <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the regular rows <transChange type="added">of bread</transChange>, and burnt offerings for mornings, evenings, Sabbaths, and new moon festivals, and for appointed feasts of Yahweh our God which <transChange type="added">are</transChange> everlasting for Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the house that I am building <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> great, for our God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> greater than all gods.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now who indeed has adequate strength to build a house for him? For the heavens and {the highest heavens}<note>Literally "the heavens of the heavens"</note> are not able to contain him. Now who <transChange type="added">am</transChange> I that I would build a house for him, except to burn incense before him?</verse>
    <verse num="7">So then, send to me skilled men to work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue fabric, knowledgeable in engraving, with the skilled men who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father has established.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Send me trees of cedar, cypress, and algum from Lebanon, for I myself know that your servants <transChange type="added">are</transChange> knowledgeable in cutting the trees of Lebanon. Now see, my servants <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> with your servants</verse>
    <verse num="9">to prepare trees in abundance for me, for the house that I am building <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> great and wonderful.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now see, I will provide twenty thousand dry measures of crushed wheat, twenty thousand dry measures of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil to the woodcarvers and those who cut timber." </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Huram<note>This is the spelling in Hebrew, though many translations have "Hiram"</note> king of Tyre answered in a letter, and he sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to Solomon: "Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them."</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Huram<note>This is the spelling in Hebrew, though many translations have "Hiram"</note> said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has made the heavens and the earth, who has given to King David a wise son knowing discretion and understanding, who will build for Yahweh a house and a royal palace for himself.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So now I have sent a skilled man, knowledgeable <transChange type="added">and with</transChange> understanding: my master<note>Or "my father"</note> Huram,</verse>
    <verse num="14">a son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and his father <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a man of Tyre, knowledgeable for working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and with purple, blue, and crimson fabric, and with fine linen, for engraving any engraving and devising any plan that is given to him, with your skilled men and the skilled men of my lord David your father.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now as for the wheat, barley, oil, and wine that my lord mentioned, let him send <transChange type="added">that</transChange> to his servants.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And we ourselves will cut trees from Lebanon according to all your need, and we will bring them to you on rafts over the sea to Joppa, so that you may bring them up to Jerusalem." </verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Solomon counted all the resident alien men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the land of Israel after the census that David his father had taken of them. And there were found one hundred and fifty-three thousand.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he appointed from them seventy thousand {to bear burdens},<note>Literally "carriers"</note> eighty thousand {to quarry}<note>Literally "stone craftsmen"</note> in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had established, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. </verse>
    <verse num="3">Now these <transChange type="added">were</transChange> the measurements of Solomon for building the house of God: the length in cubits by the former measurement <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sixty cubits, and the width <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="4">{The length of the portico that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in front was the same as the front of the width of the house}:<note>Literally "The length at the front of the portico the front of the width of the house"</note> twenty cubits. And its height <transChange type="added">was</transChange> one hundred and twenty cubits. And he overlaid it on the inside with pure gold.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the great house <transChange type="added">itself</transChange> he covered with cypress wood, then he overlaid it with pure gold. And he put on it palm tree <transChange type="added">images</transChange> and <transChange type="added">ornate</transChange> chains.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then he overlaid the house with precious stone as decoration. (Now the gold <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the gold of Parvaim.)</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he overlaid the house with gold--the beams, the thresholds, the walls, and the doors. And he carved cherubim upon the walls.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then he made {the most holy place}.<note>Literally "the house of the holy of the holies"</note> Its length {was equal to}<note>Literally "at the front of"</note> the width of the house: twenty cubits. And its breadth <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty cubits. And he overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the weight for the nails <transChange type="added">was</transChange> fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid its upper rooms with gold.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he made two sculpted wood cherubim in {the most holy place},<note>Literally "the house of the holy of the holies"</note> and he overlaid them with gold.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The length of the <transChange type="added">outstretched</transChange> wings of the cherubim <transChange type="added">were</transChange> twenty cubits; one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house, and the other wing of five cubits <transChange type="added">was</transChange> touching the <transChange type="added">outstretched</transChange> wing of the other cherub.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the wing of five cubits of the other cherub <transChange type="added">was</transChange> touching the wall of the house, and its other wing five cubits long touching the wing of the first<note>Or "other"</note> cherub.</verse>
    <verse num="13">The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they were standing on their feet, their faces toward the house.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he made the curtain of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen, and put cherubim on it.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And at the front of the house he made two columns, thirty-five cubits high, and the capital on their top was five cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he made <transChange type="added">decorative</transChange> chains in the inner sanctuary and put <transChange type="added">them</transChange> on top of the columns. And he made one hundred pomegranate <transChange type="added">ornaments</transChange>, and put them on the chains.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he erected the columns in front of the temple, one on the south and one on the north. He called the name of the southern one Jakin, and the name of the northern one Boaz. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">And he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits <transChange type="added">was</transChange> its length, and twenty cubits <transChange type="added">was</transChange> its width, and ten cubits <transChange type="added">was</transChange> its height.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then he made the sea of molten metal, from brim to brim <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> ten cubits, completely round. And <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> five cubits in height, and {its circumference measured}<note>Literally "and it measured a line all around it"</note> thirty cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Under it <transChange type="added">were</transChange> figures of oxen all around it, ten cubits <transChange type="added">high</transChange>, encircling the sea all around. The oxen <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in two rows {cast as one piece with it}.<note>Literally "molten with its casting"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4"><transChange type="added">It was</transChange> standing upon twelve oxen, three facing north, and three facing west, and three facing south, and three facing east. The sea <transChange type="added">was set</transChange> upon them from above, and all their hindquarters <transChange type="added">faced</transChange> {inward}.<note>Literally "into the house"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">And its thickness <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a handbreadth, and its brim <transChange type="added">was</transChange> like the working of the lip of a cup, the blossom of a lily. And it held three thousand baths.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he made ten basins. And he set five on the south and five on the north in which to wash; they washed off the work of the burnt offering in them, but the sea <transChange type="added">was</transChange> for the priests to wash therein.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he made ten golden lampstands according to their custom, and he set <transChange type="added">them</transChange> in the temple, five on the south and five on the north.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south and five on the north. And he made a hundred drinking bowls of gold.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he made the courtyard of the priests and the great outer courtyard and the doors for the outer court. And he overlaid their doors with bronze.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he set the sea at the southeast <transChange type="added">corner of the temple</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Huram<note>This is the spelling in Hebrew, though many translations have "Hiram"</note> made the pots, the shovels, and the drinking bowls. So Hiram<note>The spelling ("Hiram") is different here than in the previous occurrences</note> finished making the work that he made on the house of God for King Solomon:</verse>
    <verse num="12">the two columns, the bowls, and the two capitals on top of the columns, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> on top of the columns,</verse>
    <verse num="13">and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for the latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> before the columns.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he made the water carts, and he made the basins on the water carts,</verse>
    <verse num="15">and the one sea and the twelve oxen underneath it. </verse>
    <verse num="16">And Huram-abi made for King Solomon the pots, the shovels, the three-pronged meat forks, and all the utensils of polished bronze for the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="17">The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredah.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Solomon made all these utensils in great abundance, for the weight of the bronze could not be determined.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So Solomon made all the objects that <transChange type="added">were in</transChange> the house of God: the altar of gold; the tables upon which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the bread of the presence;</verse>
    <verse num="20">the lampstands, and the lamps for burning according to the custom before the inner sanctuary, of solid gold;</verse>
    <verse num="21">and the blossoms, the lamps, and the tongs that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> of solid gold;</verse>
    <verse num="22">and the snuffers, the drinking bowls, the dishes, and the firepans, of solid gold; and the entrance to the house, the inner doors to {the most holy place}, and the doors to the house of the temple <transChange type="added">were</transChange> of gold. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">When all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished, Solomon brought the holy objects of David his father: the silver, the gold, and all the objects he had put into the storehouses of the house of God.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> for the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> to Jerusalem in order to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the city of David, which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Zion.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast that <transChange type="added">is in</transChange> the seventh month.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they brought up the ark, the tent of assembly,<note>Or "meeting"</note> and all the holy objects that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the tent; the Levitical priests brought them up.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And King Solomon and the whole community of Israel that was assembled before him <transChange type="added">were</transChange> before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted nor numbered for abundance.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then the priests brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, into {the most holy place}, underneath the wings of the cherubim.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The cherubim were spreading <transChange type="added">their</transChange> wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim were covering the ark and over its poles <transChange type="added">from</transChange> above.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But the poles were <transChange type="added">so</transChange> long that the ends of the poles from the ark were seen from before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from the outside. And they are there until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="10">There was nothing in the ark but the two stone tablets that Moses had put <transChange type="added">inside</transChange> at Horeb <transChange type="added">on</transChange> which Yahweh had {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant with the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> when they went out from Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And when the priests came out of the sanctuary (for all the priests who were present<note>Or "who were found"</note> sanctified themselves without keeping their divisions)</verse>
    <verse num="12">and all the Levitical singers--Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons, their brothers, dressed <transChange type="added">in</transChange> fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and stringed instruments--<transChange type="added">they</transChange> were standing to the east of the altar. And with them outside <transChange type="added">were</transChange> one hundred and twenty priests <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> trumpet blowers.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it was the primary <transChange type="added">duty</transChange> of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard <transChange type="added">with</transChange> one voice, to praise and give thanks to Yahweh. And when a sound from the trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments of song was raised to Yahweh--for he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good, because his loyal love <transChange type="added">is</transChange> everlasting--then the house, the house of Yahweh, was filled with a cloud.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Then Solomon said, "Yahweh has decided<note>Or "said"</note> to dwell in the deep gloom.</verse>
    <verse num="2">But I have built for you an exalted house, even a place for you to dwell in forever."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then the king turned around<note>Or "turned his face"</note> and blessed all the assembly of Israel, and all the assembly of Israel were standing.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth with David my father, and with his hands he has fulfilled <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="5">'From the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt I did not choose a city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in order for my name <transChange type="added">to be</transChange> there. Nor did I choose a man to be leader over my people Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But I have chosen my name to be there in Jerusalem, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.'</verse>
    <verse num="7">Now, it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But Yahweh said to David my father, 'Because it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart,</verse>
    <verse num="9">but you yourself will not build the house, but your son who will proceed from your loins; he himself will build the house for my name.'</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now Yahweh has fulfilled his word that he spoke. I have risen in the place of David my father and am seated on the throne of Israel as Yahweh has spoken. I have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And I have there the ark <transChange type="added">in</transChange> which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the covenant of Yahweh that he {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> with the {Israelites}."<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh before all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.</verse>
    <verse num="13">(For Solomon had made a platform of bronze five cubits long and five cubits wide and three cubits high, and placed it in the midst of the outer court.) And he stood upon it, then knelt down on his knees before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands to heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he said, "O Yahweh, God of Israel, there is none like you, a God in the heavens and on the earth, keeping the covenant and loyal love with your servants who walk before you with all their heart,</verse>
    <verse num="15">that you have kept for your servant David my father what you spoke to him. You spoke with your mouth, and by your hand you have fulfilled <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on this day.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And now, O Yahweh, God of Israel, keep for your servant David, my father, what you have spoken to him, saying, '{You shall not lack}<note>Literally "There shall not be cut off"</note> a man to sit on the throne of Israel before me, if only your sons keep their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.'</verse>
    <verse num="17">And now, O Yahweh, God of Israel, let your word that you have spoken to your servant David be confirmed. </verse>
    <verse num="18">"But will God indeed dwell with humankind upon the earth? Look, the heavens and {the highest heavens}<note>Literally "the heavens of the heavens"</note> cannot contain you! Surely then this house that I have built <transChange type="added">will not contain you!</transChange></verse>
    <verse num="19">But turn to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O Yahweh my God, to hearken to the pleading and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you,</verse>
    <verse num="20">that your eyes may be open day and night to this house, to the place that you have promised to place your name there, that you may hear the prayer that your servant has prayed to this place.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And listen to the pleas of your servant and your people Israel when they pray toward this place, that you yourself might hear from the place of your dwelling, from the heavens, that you might hear and forgive. </verse>
    <verse num="22">"If a man sins against his neighbor and {makes him swear an oath}<note>Literally "places upon him an oath to swear an oath"</note> and comes <transChange type="added">with</transChange> an oath before your altar in this house,</verse>
    <verse num="23">then may you yourself hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants, to repay the guilty by bringing his way upon his head and to vindicate the righteous by giving to him according to his righteousness. </verse>
    <verse num="24">"And if your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against you and they repent and confess your name and pray and plead before you in this house,</verse>
    <verse num="25">then may you yourself hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel and again bring them back to the land that you gave to them and to their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="26">"When the heavens are stopped up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you and they pray to this place and confess your name and turn back from their sin when you humble them,</verse>

    <verse num="28">"If there is a famine in the land; if there is disease, blight, mildew, locust, and caterpillar; if it happens that his enemy lays siege to him in the land <transChange type="added">and</transChange> his gates; any kind of plague, any kind of disease,</verse>
    <verse num="29"><transChange type="added">then</transChange> any prayer, any plea that is <transChange type="added">made</transChange> by any person and by all your people Israel, each one who knows his own affliction and his own anguish and <transChange type="added">who</transChange> spreads out his hands to this house,</verse>
    <verse num="30">then may you yourself hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, and forgive and give to each according to all his ways, since you know the heart of the children of humankind,</verse>

    <verse num="32">"And also, with respect to the foreigner, he who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not of your people Israel, but comes from a distant land, for the sake of your great name and your powerful hand and outstretched arm, when he comes and prays to this house,</verse>
    <verse num="33">then may you yourself hear from the heavens, from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all peoples of earth will know of your name and fear you, as <transChange type="added">do</transChange> your people Israel, and that they may know that your name {possesses}<note>Literally "is called over"</note> this house that I have built. </verse>
    <verse num="34">"When your people go out to battle against their enemy according to the way that you have sent them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,</verse>

  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">And when Solomon finished praying, then fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of Yahweh filled the house.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the priests were not able to go into the house of Yahweh, for the glory of Yahweh had filled the house.</verse>
    <verse num="3">When all the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> saw the fire come down and the glory of Yahweh upon the house, they knelt down <transChange type="added">with their</transChange> faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to Yahweh, for <transChange type="added">he is</transChange> good, for his loyal love <transChange type="added">is</transChange> everlasting. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the king and all the people were offering a sacrifice before Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the priests stood at their posts with the Levites, with the instruments of the song of Yahweh that King David had made to give thanks to Yahweh--for his loyal love <transChange type="added">is</transChange> everlasting--whenever David offered praise by their hand. Now the priests sounded trumpets <transChange type="added">standing</transChange> opposite them, and all Israel stood. </verse>
    <verse num="7">And Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> before the house of Yahweh, for there he had made the burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, for the bronze altar that Solomon had made was not able to hold the burnt offerings, cereal offerings, and the fat. </verse>
    <verse num="8">And Solomon held<note>Or "made"</note> a feast at that time <transChange type="added">of</transChange> seven days. And all Israel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him, a very great assembly, from Lebo-Hamath to the river of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And on the eighth day they made a solemn assembly, for they held<note>Or "made"</note> the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents rejoicing and festive of heart on account of the goodness that Yahweh had done for David, Solomon, and Israel his people.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Solomon finished the house of Yahweh and the house of the king. And all that came into the heart of Solomon to do with respect to the house of Yahweh and his own house he accomplished. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Yahweh appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.</verse>
    <verse num="13">When I hold back the heavens so that there is not rain, and when I command the locust to devour the earth, and if I send disease among my people,</verse>
    <verse num="14"><transChange type="added">then if</transChange> my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and will pray and will seek my face and will turn from their evil ways, then I myself shall hear from the heavens and will forgive their sins and heal their land.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And now I have chosen and consecrated this house for my name to be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there {for all time}.<note>Literally "all the days"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">Now <transChange type="added">as for</transChange> you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked and do according to all that I have commanded you and will keep my ordinances and judgments,</verse>
    <verse num="18">then I will establish the throne of your kingdom as I promised<note>Or "covenanted"</note> to David your father, saying, 'A man shall not be cut off for you <transChange type="added">from</transChange> ruling over Israel.' </verse>
    <verse num="19">"But if you turn yourselves away and forsake my ordinances and my commandments which I have given before you <transChange type="added">all</transChange> and will go and serve other gods and bow down to them,</verse>
    <verse num="20">then I will uproot them from upon my land that I have given to them, and this house that I have consecrated for my name I will send away from before my face, and I will make it a proverb and a taunt among all the nations.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And <transChange type="added">as for</transChange> this house, which was exalted, all who pass by it will be appalled and will say, 'Why has Yahweh done thus to this land and to this house?'</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then they will say, 'Because they forsook Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and <transChange type="added">they</transChange> laid hold of other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore he has brought upon them all this evil.'" </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> at the end of twenty years <transChange type="added">in</transChange> which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh and his own house,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Solomon also built the cities that Huram<note>This is the spelling in Hebrew, though many translations have "Hiram"</note> had given to him, and he settled the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> in them.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Solomon went to Hamath-Zobah and laid siege upon it.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he built Tadmor in the desert, and he built all the storage cities in Hamath.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He also built Upper Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon, fortified cities <transChange type="added">with</transChange> walls, gates, and bars;</verse>
    <verse num="6">Baalath and all the storage cities that belonged to Solomon; all the cities for chariots<note>Hebrew "chariot"</note> and cities for horses; and any desire of Solomon that he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</verse>
    <verse num="7">All the people who remained from the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites who were not from Israel,</verse>
    <verse num="8">from the descendants<note>Or "sons/children"</note> who were left over after them in the land, whom the Israelites had not destroyed, Solomon conscripted them as forced labor until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But from the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> Solomon did not give as servants for his work, but they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> men of war, his commanders of his officers, and commanders of his chariots<note>Hebrew "chariot"</note> and his horses.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And these <transChange type="added">were</transChange> the commanders of the garrisons that belonged to King Solomon, two hundred and fifty who exercised authority over the people. </verse>
    <verse num="11">And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, "My wife shall not dwell in the house of David, king of Israel, for those <transChange type="added">places</transChange> to which the ark of Yahweh has come <transChange type="added">are</transChange> holy.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh that he had built before the portico,</verse>
    <verse num="13">{as was the daily requirement},<note>Literally "with respect to the word of the day, by day"</note> to offer up according to the commandments of Moses for Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and the three {annual}<note>Literally "occurrences in the year"</note> feasts: the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And in accord with the ordinance of David his father he appointed working groups of priests for their service, Levites for their responsibilities for praise and cultic service before the priests {according to the daily requirement},<note>Literally "according to the word of the day, by day"</note> and the gatekeepers in their working groups, gate by gate. For thus David the man of God had commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they did not turn aside from the commandment of the king concerning the priests and the Levites concerning anything, and concerning the treasury rooms.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Solomon accomplished all the work from the day the foundation stone <transChange type="added">was laid for</transChange> the house of Yahweh until its completion, and the house of Yahweh was finished.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Solomon went to Ezion-Geber, and to Elath, on the edge of the sea in the land of Edom.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Huram<note>This is the spelling in Hebrew, though many translations have "Hiram"</note> sent to him, by the hand of his servants, ships and servants knowledgeable of the sea. And they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and from there they collected four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">Now the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, and she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with hard questions, with much wealth and camels, bearing spices and much gold and precious stones. And she came to Solomon and told him all that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> {on her mind}.<note>Literally "in her heart"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">And Solomon {answered all her questions}.<note>Literally "made known to her all her words"</note> Not a word was hidden from Solomon that he did not answer for her.</verse>
    <verse num="3">When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon and the house he had built,</verse>
    <verse num="4">and the food of his table, and the position of his officers, the duty of his servants and their clothing, his cupbearers and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of Yahweh, there was no longer any breath<note>Or "spirit"</note> in her.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And she said to the king, "The word which I heard in my land concerning your words and your wisdom <transChange type="added">is</transChange> true,</verse>
    <verse num="6">but I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes. And behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not reported to me; you surpass the rumors that I had heard.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Blessed <transChange type="added">are</transChange> your men, and blessed <transChange type="added">are</transChange> these your servants who stand before you regularly and hear your wisdom!</verse>
    <verse num="8">Blessed be Yahweh your God who took delight in you, to put you on his throne as king for Yahweh your God! Because your God loved Israel, he established him forever and has put you over them as king to do justice and righteousness!"</verse>
    <verse num="9">And she gave to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great amount of spices and precious stones. And there were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. </verse>
    <verse num="10">Moreover the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir brought algum wood and precious stones.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the king made steps for the house of Yahweh and the house of the king, and lyres and harps for the singers <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the algum wood. And there was not seen <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> like them before in the land of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba every desired thing she asked, besides what she had brought to the king. Then she turned and went to her land, she and her servants. </verse>
    <verse num="13">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year <transChange type="added">was</transChange> six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</verse>
    <verse num="14">besides the gold and silver the traders and merchants brought, and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And King Solomon made two hundred shields of beaten gold; six hundred <transChange type="added">shekels</transChange> of beaten gold went into each shield.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And <transChange type="added">he made</transChange> three hundred small shields of beaten gold; three hundred <transChange type="added">shekels</transChange> went into each small shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the king made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold <transChange type="added">was</transChange> attached to the throne. And <transChange type="added">there were</transChange> armrests {on each side}.<note>Literally "from this and from that"</note> And by {the seat}<note>Literally "the place of sitting"</note> <transChange type="added">were</transChange> two lions standing beside the armrests.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And twelve lions were standing there on <transChange type="added">each</transChange> of the six steps {on each end}.<note>Literally "from this and from that"</note> And there was nothing like <transChange type="added">it</transChange> made in all the kingdom.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And all the drinking vessels of King Solomon <transChange type="added">were</transChange> of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon <transChange type="added">were</transChange> of pure gold. Silver was not valued as anything in the days of Solomon.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For the ships of the king went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram.<note>This is the spelling in Hebrew, though many translations have "Hiram"</note> Once {every three years}<note>Literally "for three years"</note> the ships of Tarshish came carrying gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. </verse>
    <verse num="22">Thus King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And all the kings of the earth sought the face of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God put in his heart.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And each of them brought his gifts, objects of silver, objects of gold, cloaks, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, <transChange type="added">as</transChange> an amount year by year.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And he ruled over all the kings from the River<note>That is, the Euphrates</note> to the land of the Philistines, to the boundary of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as the sycamore trees that <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in the Shephelah for abundance.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And the horses <transChange type="added">were</transChange> imported from Egypt and from all lands for Solomon. </verse>
    <verse num="29">As for the remainder of the words of Solomon <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the first to the last, are they not written in the chronicles<note>Or "words"</note> of Nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer, concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And Solomon slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and they buried him in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Shechem to make him king.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard <transChange type="added">it</transChange>--now he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon--Jeroboam returned from Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And they sent and called him. Then Jeroboam and all Israel went, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="4">"Your father made our yoke heavy. Now, therefore, lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve you."</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he said to them, "In three days return to me again." And the people went away. </verse>
    <verse num="6">Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the elders who had been {serving}<note>Literally "standing"</note> before Solomon his father when he was alive, saying, "What word do you advise to answer this people?"</verse>
    <verse num="7">And they said to him, "If you will be good to this people and please them, then speak good words to them. Then they will be your servants {forever}."<note>Literally "all the days"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">But he forsook the advice of the elders that advised him and took counsel of the young men who had grown up with him who were {serving}<note>Literally "standing"</note> before him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he said to them, "What do you advise that we should say in return to this people, who said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father has put upon us'?"</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the young men who had grown up with him said to him, "Thus you should say to this people who have said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, so you yourself should lighten <transChange type="added">it</transChange> for us.' Thus you should say to them, 'My little finger <transChange type="added">is</transChange> thicker than the loins of my father.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So now, my father laid upon you a heavy yoke, but I myself will add to the yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I myself <transChange type="added">will do so</transChange> with scorpions.'" </verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had spoken, saying, "Return to me on the third day."</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam forsook the advice of the elders.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, "I will make your yoke heavy, and I myself will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I <transChange type="added">will do so</transChange> with scorpions."</verse>
    <verse num="15">So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turning <transChange type="added">of events</transChange> from God, so that Yahweh might fulfill his word that he had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.</verse>
    <verse num="16">So all Israel <transChange type="added">saw</transChange> that the king would not listen to them, and the people answered the king, saying, "What portion <transChange type="added">is there</transChange> for us in David? <transChange type="added">We have</transChange> no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each to your tents, O Israel! Now look to your own house, David!" And all Israel went to their own tents.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But as for the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> who were living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam ruled over them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was {in charge of}<note>Literally "over"</note> the forced labor, but the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> stoned him with stones, and he died. Then King Rehoboam hastily went up into the chariot to flee to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So Israel has rebelled against the house of David until this day. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand {chosen warriors},<note>Literally "chosen makers of war"</note> to fight against Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.</verse>
    <verse num="2">But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="3">"Say to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,</verse>
    <verse num="4">'Thus says Yahweh: "Do not go up, and do not fight against your brothers. Return, each man to his house, for this matter has come from me." '" So they obeyed the words of Yahweh and turned back from going against Jeroboam. </verse>
    <verse num="5">And Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built cities as strongholds in Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="6">He built Bethlehem, Etah, Tekoa,</verse>
    <verse num="7">Beth-Zur, Socoh, Adullam,</verse>
    <verse num="8">Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,</verse>
    <verse num="9">Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,</verse>
    <verse num="10">Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in Judah and in Benjamin.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he strengthened the fortifications and put commanders in them, <transChange type="added">along with</transChange> stores of food, olive oil, and wine.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And in all the cities <transChange type="added">he put</transChange> shields and spears, and he greatly strengthened them. So he had Judah and Benjamin. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Now the priests and the Levites who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> throughout all Israel took their stand with him<note>That is, Rehoboam</note> from all their territories.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For the Levites left their pasturelands and their property and came to Judah and to Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for the bull calves that he had made.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then after them, from all the tribes of Israel, those who set their heart to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to offer to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, secure for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years. </verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Rehoboam took to himself as a wife Mahalath, the daughter<note>This follows the reading tradition (Qere); the Kethib reading has "son"</note> of Yerimot son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And she bore to him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines (for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters).</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief and crown prince over his brothers, in order to make him king.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons throughout all the land of Judah and Benjamin, through all the fortified cities, and gave abundant provisions to them and obtained many wives <transChange type="added">for them</transChange>. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">And when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and when he was strengthened, he forsook the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> in the fifth year of King Rehoboam (for they had acted unfaithfully against Yahweh), Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem</verse>
    <verse num="3">with one thousand two hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. And there was no number to the people who came up with him from Egypt--Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he took the fortified cities that belonged to Judah, and he came up to Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem from before Shishak. And he said to them, "Thus says Yahweh: 'You yourselves have abandoned me, and I myself have surely abandoned you into the hand of Shishak.'"</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> righteous."</verse>
    <verse num="7">And when Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, "They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy. I will give to them some way of escape, that my anger not be poured out against Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</verse>
    <verse num="8">However, they shall be his servants, that they might know my service and the service of the kingdoms of <transChange type="added">other</transChange> countries." </verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and he took the treasures out of the house of Yahweh and the treasures out of the king's house. He took everything. He also took the small shields of gold that Solomon had made.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And King Rehoboam made small shields of bronze in their place and committed them into the hand of the commanders of the guards who were keeping the entrance of the house of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And whenever the king went into the house of Yahweh, the guards came and carried them, and then they returned them to the alcove of the guards.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And when he humbled himself, the anger of Yahweh was turned away from him, so that he did not destroy <transChange type="added">the city</transChange> completely. Moreover, matters were well in Judah. </verse>
    <verse num="13">So King Rehoboam was strengthened in Jerusalem, and he reigned <transChange type="added">there</transChange>. Now, Rehoboam <transChange type="added">was</transChange> forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city where Yahweh had chosen to put his name out of all the tribes of Israel. And the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Naamah the Ammonite.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="15">Now the words of Rehoboam <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the first to the last, are they not written in the chronicles<note>Or "words"</note> of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer as a record? And <transChange type="added">there were</transChange> battles <transChange type="added">between</transChange> Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their<note>Or "the"</note> days.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Rehoboam slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and he was buried in the city of David, and Abijah his son reigned in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah reigned over Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. </verse>
    <verse num="3">And Abijah joined in the battle with an army of four hundred thousand {battle-hardened warriors},<note>Literally "mighty warriors of battle"</note> chosen men, and Jeroboam put the battle in order against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, an army of mighty warriors. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Abijah stood up on top of Mount Zemaraim that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the hill country of Ephraim and said, "Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel!</verse>

    <verse num="6">But Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master,</verse>
    <verse num="7">and worthless men, {sons of wickedness},<note>Literally "sons of Belial"</note> were gathered about him and became hostile against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was a boy and gentle of heart and was not strong enough <transChange type="added">to stand</transChange> before them.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So now you yourselves are considering <transChange type="added">that you are</transChange> strong before the kingdom of Yahweh <transChange type="added">which is</transChange> in the hand the sons of David, since you yourselves are a great multitude and you have bull calves of gold that Jeroboam has made for idols.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Did you not drive out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, the Levites? Have you <transChange type="added">not</transChange> made for yourselves priests like all the peoples of the lands? All who come {to be consecrated for priestly service}<note>Literally "to fill his hand" (a Hebrew idiom for ordination)</note> with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> not a god.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But as for us, Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests serving Yahweh <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the sons of Aaron, the Levites, according to their service.</verse>
    <verse num="11">They offer burnt offerings to Yahweh {every morning}<note>Literally "in the morning, in the morning"</note> and {every evening},<note>Literally "in the evening, in the evening"</note> sweet spices of incense, and the rows of bread upon the pure table. And the golden lampstand with its lamps <transChange type="added">they</transChange> keep kindled {every evening},<note>Literally "in the evening, in the evening"</note> for we are keeping the requirement of Yahweh our God, but you yourselves have forsaken him.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And look, God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with us at the head, and his priests <transChange type="added">have</transChange> the trumpets for sounding blasts against you, O sons of Israel. Do not fight against Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> for you will not succeed." </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Jeroboam sent around an ambush to come behind them. So they were in front of Judah, but the ambush <transChange type="added">was</transChange> behind them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">When Judah turned, then behold, the battle against them <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in front and behind, and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests blew on the trumpets.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then the men of Judah shouted, and it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when the men of Judah were shouting, then God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> fled from before Judah, and God gave them into their hand.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Abijah and his people struck a great blow against them, and the dead from Israel <transChange type="added">that</transChange> fell <transChange type="added">were</transChange> five hundred thousand chosen men.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> were subdued at that time, and the people<note>Or "sons"</note> of Judah were victorious, for they relied upon Yahweh the God of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="19">And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Jeroboam did not regain strength again in the days of Abijah. And Yahweh plagued him and he died.</verse>
    <verse num="21">But Abijah became strong, and he took to himself fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Now the rest of the words of Abijah and his ways and his words are written in the story of the prophet Iddo. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="14">
    <verse num="1"><note>2 Chronicles 14:1-15 in the English Bible is 13:23-14:14 in the Hebrew Bible</note> And Abijah slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son became king in his place. In his days the land was at rest ten years.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Asa did that which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God.</verse>
    <verse num="3">He removed the foreign altars and high places, broke down the stone pillars, and cut down the Asherahs.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and to keep the law and the commandment.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he removed the high places and the incense stands from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom had rest under<note>Or "before"</note> him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land was at rest. Under<note>Or "With"</note> him there was no war in those years, for Yahweh had given rest to him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he said to Judah, "Let us build these cities and surround <transChange type="added">them with</transChange> walls, towers, gates, and bars while the land <transChange type="added">is</transChange> before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought and he has given rest to us on every side." So they built and had success.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Asa had an army <transChange type="added">of</transChange> three hundred thousand from Judah, bearing shields and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin <transChange type="added">who</transChange> carried shields and drew bows. All of these <transChange type="added">were</transChange> mighty warriors of strength. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Zerah the Cushite came out against them with an army of a thousand thousands and three hundred chariots. And he came to Mareshah.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Asa went out before him, and a battle was put in order in the valley of Zepah at Mareshah. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Asa cried out to Yahweh his God. And he said, "O Yahweh, there is none with you to help between the great and the powerless. Help us, O Yahweh our God, for we rely upon you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O Yahweh, you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> our God! Let no man prevail against you!" </verse>
    <verse num="12">So Yahweh defeated the Cushites before Asa and before Judah, and the Cushites fled.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Asa and the army<note>Or "people"</note> with him pursued them to Gerar. And <transChange type="added">many</transChange> from the Cushites fell, for they had no deliverance, for they were shattered before Yahweh and before his army. And they carried away much war booty.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of Yahweh was upon them. And they plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they also struck the tents of the herdsmen and carried away many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="15">
    <verse num="1">Now Azariah the son of Oded--the Spirit of God came upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he went out before Asa and said to him, "Hear me, O Asa and all of Judah and Benjamin! Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with you while you are with him. And if you will seek him he will be found by you. But if you forsake him he will forsake you.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Now Israel <transChange type="added">has been</transChange> without the true God many days, and without a teaching priest, and without law,</verse>
    <verse num="4">but at its trouble he returned to Yahweh, the God of Israel. They sought him, and he was found by them.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And in those times there was no peace for the one going out and the one coming in, for great tumults <transChange type="added">were</transChange> upon all the inhabitants of the lands.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Nation was crushed by nation, and city <transChange type="added">was</transChange> against city, for God threw them into confusion by all <transChange type="added">sorts of</transChange> trouble.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But as for you, be strong and let not your hands be weak, for there is reward for your labor." </verse>
    <verse num="8">And when Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the vile idols from all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim, and he repaired the altar of Yahweh that was in front of the portico of Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="9">And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and those sojourning with them, from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for many had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that Yahweh his God <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And they were gathered <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And they sacrificed to Yahweh on that day from the war booty they brought back: seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And they entered into a covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> with all their heart and with all their inmost being,<note>Or "soul"</note></verse>
    <verse num="13">but all who will not seek Yahweh the God of Israel should be killed, from young to old, from men to women.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they took an oath to Yahweh with a great voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with horns.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they swore with all their heart. And they sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and Yahweh gave rest to them all around. </verse>
    <verse num="16">And also Maacah, the mother of Asa, the king removed her from <transChange type="added">being</transChange> queen, because she had made a repulsive image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her repulsive image, and he crushed and burned <transChange type="added">it</transChange> at the Wadi<note>Or "valley"; a wadi is a valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> Kidron.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was fully devoted all his days.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he brought the holy objects of his father and his own holy objects <transChange type="added">into</transChange> the house of God--silver and gold and vessels.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="16">
    <verse num="1">In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha the king of Israel went up against Judah. And he built Ramah in order not to allow <transChange type="added">anyone</transChange> to go out or come in to Asa, king of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the storehouses of the house of Yahweh and the house of the king, and he sent <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to Ben-Hadad, king of Aram,<note>Or "Syria"</note> who lived in Damascus, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="3">"<transChange type="added">There is</transChange> a covenant between me and you, <transChange type="added">as there was</transChange> between my father and your father. Look, I am sending you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha, king of Israel, that he might withdraw from me." </verse>
    <verse num="4">And Ben-Hadad listened to King Asa, and he sent commanders of his troops that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him against the cities of Israel. And they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when Baasha heard <transChange type="added">this</transChange>, he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then King Asa took all of Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and he built Geba and Mizpah with them. </verse>
    <verse num="7">And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, "On account of your reliance upon the king of Aram,<note>Or "Syria"</note> and <transChange type="added">since</transChange> you did not rely on Yahweh your God, therefore the troops of the king of Aram<note>Or "Syria"</note> escaped from your hand.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with very abundant chariots and horsemen? And because of your reliance on Yahweh he gave them into your hand.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For the eyes of Yahweh roam throughout all the earth to strengthen those whose heart is fully devoted to him. You have been foolish in this, for from now on you will have wars." </verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in {the prison},<note>Literally "the house of the stocks"</note> for he was enraged with him concerning this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Now behold, the words of Asa <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the first to the last, behold, they are written in the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, he fell {severely}<note>Literally "until his illness unto severity"</note> ill in his feet. But even in his illness he did not seek Yahweh, but <transChange type="added">only</transChange> among the healers.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Asa slept with his ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> And he died in the forty-first year of his reign.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they buried him in his burial site, which had been cut out for him in the city of David. And they laid him on the bier which they had filled with all kinds of spices made <transChange type="added">by</transChange> the perfumers as a fragment ointment. And they made a great fire in his honor. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="17">
    <verse num="1">And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he put troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had taken.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of David his father and did not seek after the Baals,</verse>
    <verse num="4">but he sought after the God of his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> and walked in his commandments and not according to the works of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="5">So Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah gave tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had much wealth and honor.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And his heart was courageous in the ways of Yahweh. Moreover, he removed the high places and the Asherahs from Judah. </verse>
    <verse num="7">In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;</verse>
    <verse num="8">and with them the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah; and with them the priests Elisham and Joram.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they taught in Judah, and the scroll of the law of Yahweh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with them when they went around in all the cities of Judah, and they taught the people. </verse>
    <verse num="10">And the fear of Yahweh was upon all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, and they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And some of the Philistines brought a gift and silver to Jehoshaphat <transChange type="added">as</transChange> tribute. The Arabians also brought him seven thousand seven hundred sheep and seven thousand seven hundred goats. </verse>
    <verse num="12">And Jehoshaphat {grew greater and greater},<note>Literally "was going and becoming great to the height"</note> and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he had many supplies in the cities of Judah and mighty warriors for battle in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Now these <transChange type="added">were</transChange> their enrollment by the house of their ancestors:<note>Or "fathers"</note> of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah, the commander, and with him <transChange type="added">were</transChange> three hundred thousand mighty armed warriors;</verse>
    <verse num="15">and at his side,<note>Or "hand"</note> Jehohanan the commander, and with him <transChange type="added">were</transChange> two hundred and eighty thousand;</verse>
    <verse num="16">and at his side,<note>Or "hand"</note> Amasiah the son of Zicri, who had made a freewill offering to Yahweh, and with him <transChange type="added">were</transChange> two hundred thousand mighty armed warriors.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And from Benjamin: Eliada, a powerful mighty warrior, and with him <transChange type="added">were</transChange> two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;</verse>
    <verse num="18">and at his side,<note>Or "hand"</note> Jehozabad, and with him <transChange type="added">were</transChange> one hundred and eighty thousand armed for war.</verse>
    <verse num="19">These were serving the king, besides <transChange type="added">those</transChange> whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="18">
    <verse num="1">Now Jehoshaphat had much wealth and honor, and he became son-in-law to Ahab.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And {after some years}<note>Literally "at the end of years"</note> he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and for the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, and urged him to go up against Ramoth-Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Ahab the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, "Will you go up with me to Ramoth-Gilead?" And he answered him, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> as you <transChange type="added">are</transChange>, and my people <transChange type="added">are</transChange> as your people with you in war." </verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Seek {first of all}<note>Literally "as the day"</note> the word of Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men. And he said to them, "Shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall we cease?" And they said, "Go up, since God will give <transChange type="added">it</transChange> into the hand of the king."</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here another prophet of Yahweh that we might inquire of him?"</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "<transChange type="added">There is</transChange> yet one man by whom to seek Yahweh, but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but {always}<note>Literally "all his days"</note> disaster. He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Micaiah the son of Imlah." Then Jehoshaphat said, "Let not the king say thus."</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then the king of Israel called to a eunuch and said, "Quickly bring Micaiah the son of Imlah." </verse>
    <verse num="9">Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, clothed in robes. And they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Zedekiah the son of Kenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said, "Thus says Yahweh: 'With these you will gore Aram<note>Or "Syria"</note> to their destruction.'"</verse>
    <verse num="11">And all the prophets prophesied thus, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and triumph! Yahweh will give it into the hand of the king." </verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him, "Behold, the words of the prophets <transChange type="added">are</transChange> good with one voice to the king. Please let your word be as one with them and speak good."</verse>
    <verse num="13">But Micaiah said, "As Yahweh lives, only what my God has said, that will I speak." </verse>
    <verse num="14">And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to war or shall I cease?" And he said, "Go up and triumph! They shall be given into your hand."</verse>
    <verse num="15">But the king said to him, "How many times shall I make you swear that you speak nothing except the truth in the name of Yahweh?"</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then he said, "I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains like sheep that had no shepherd. And Yahweh said, 'These have no masters; let them return to his own house in peace.'"</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not say to you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but only disaster?"</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting upon his throne with all the host of heaven standing on his right and on his left.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Yahweh said, 'Who will entice Ahab the king of Israel that he would go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?' And one said this, and another said that.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then a spirit came forth and stood before Yahweh and said, 'I will entice him.' Then Yahweh said to him, 'By what means?'</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then he said, 'I will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And he said, 'You will entice him and will also succeed. Go out and do so.'</verse>
    <verse num="22">So now, behold, Yahweh has put a spirit of deception into the mouths of these your prophets. Yahweh has spoken disaster against you." </verse>
    <verse num="23">Then Zedekiah the son of Kenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, "{Which way}<note>Literally "Where is this the way"</note> did the Spirit of Yahweh come from me to speak to you?"</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then Micaiah said, "Behold, you will see on that day when you go into a private room to hide yourself."</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then the king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the commander of the city and to Jehoash the son of the king,</verse>
    <verse num="26">and say, 'Thus says the king: "Put this one into the prison house, and let him eat {a meager ration of bread and water}<note>Literally "bread a short ration and water a short ration"</note> until I return in peace." '"</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Micaiah said, "If you surely return in peace Yahweh has not spoken with me." Then he said, "Hear, peoples, all of them!" </verse>
    <verse num="28">Then the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you, wear your garments." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went to war.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Now the king of Aram<note>Or "Syria"</note> had commanded the commanders of his chariots,<note>Hebrew "chariot"</note> saying, "Do not fight with the small <transChange type="added">or</transChange> the great, but only with the king of Israel."</verse>
    <verse num="31">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when the commanders of the chariots<note>Hebrew "chariot"</note> saw Jehoshaphat, then they said, "It <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the king of Israel!" And they turned against him to fight. Then Jehoshaphat cried out and Yahweh helped him. God drove them away from him.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when the commanders of the chariots<note>Hebrew "chariot"</note> saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from following him.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Now a certain man drew the bow {at random}<note>Literally "in his innocence"</note> and struck the king of Israel between the soldering of <transChange type="added">his</transChange> breastplate armor. Then he said to the chariot driver, "{Turn around};<note>Literally "Turn away your hand"</note> get me away from the <transChange type="added">war</transChange> camp, for I am wounded."</verse>
    <verse num="34">And the battle went on that day, and the king of Israel was propped up in the chariot facing Aram<note>Or "Syria"</note> until the evening. And he died at the time of the going down of the sun. </verse>

  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">Then Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.</verse>

    <verse num="3">Nevertheless some good things have been found in regard to you, for you burned the Asherahs out of the land and set your heart to seek God." </verse>
    <verse num="4">And Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and returned and went out among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">And he appointed judges in the land and in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city.</verse>

    <verse num="8">Moreover, Jehoshaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the Levites and the priests and heads of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> of Israel as judges and to decide legal disputes for Yahweh.

    <verse num="3">Then Jehoshaphat was afraid and set his face to seek Yahweh. And he called for a fast through all Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Judah assembled to seek after Yahweh; even from all the cities of Judah they came to seek Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of Yahweh before the new courtyard.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he said, "O Yahweh, God of our ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> are you not God in heaven? Now you rule in all the kingdoms of the nations, and in your hand <transChange type="added">are</transChange> power and might, and there is none <transChange type="added">who can</transChange> resist against you.</verse>
    <verse num="7">O, our God, did you yourself not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it to the descendants<note>Or "seed"</note> of Abraham your friend forever?</verse>
    <verse num="8">And they lived in it and built for you a sanctuary for your name in it, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">'If disaster, a sword, punishment, disease, or famine come upon us, we shall stand before this house and before you--for your name <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in this house--and cry out to you out of our trouble, then you will hear and save <transChange type="added">us</transChange>.'</verse>
    <verse num="10">And now, look, the people<note>Or "sons"</note> of Moab and Ammon and Mount Seir whom you did not allow Israel to come against when they came from Egypt, from whom they turned aside and did not destroy,</verse>
    <verse num="11">now behold, they are rewarding us by coming to dispossess us from your possession which you gave us as an inheritance.</verse>
    <verse num="12">O our God, will you not judge them, for there is no power in us before this great multitude that is coming against us. Now we do not know what we shall do, for our eyes <transChange type="added">are</transChange> upon you." </verse>
    <verse num="13">And all Judah was standing before Yahweh, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> also their little children, their wives, and their children.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then the Spirit of Yahweh came upon Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite from the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he said, "Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat, thus says Yahweh to you: 'Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed before this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God's.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they are coming up the ascent of Ziz. And you will find them at the end of the valley facing the desert of Jeruel.</verse>
    <verse num="17"><transChange type="added">There will be</transChange> no <transChange type="added">need</transChange> for you to fight in this <transChange type="added">battle</transChange>. Take your stand! Stand and see the deliverance of Yahweh among you, O Judah and Jerusalem! Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Tomorrow go out before them and Yahweh <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> with you.'"</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Jehoshaphat bowed his face<note>Literally "nostrils"</note> down to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before Yahweh to worship Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then the Levites, from the {Kohathites}<note>Literally "sons of the Kohathites"</note> and from the {Korahites}<note>Literally "sons of the Korahites"</note> stood up to praise Yahweh the God of Israel with an exceedingly<note>Literally "above"</note> loud voice. </verse>
    <verse num="20">And they rose up early in the morning and went out to the desert of Tekoa. And when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God, and you shall be established! Believe in his prophets, and you shall succeed!"</verse>
    <verse num="21">And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed singers to Yahweh <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> giving praise to the splendor of <transChange type="added">his</transChange> holiness when they went out before the army. And they said, "Give thanks to Yahweh, for his loyal love <transChange type="added">is</transChange> everlasting!" </verse>
    <verse num="22">And {when}<note>Or "on time" or "at the time"</note> they began with singing and praise, Yahweh set ambushes against the people<note>Or "sons"</note> of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir who were coming against Judah. And they were defeated</verse>
    <verse num="23">when the people<note>Or "sons"</note> of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to destroy and demolish <transChange type="added">them</transChange>. And when the inhabitants of Seir had made an end of them, each helped to destroy his comrade. </verse>
    <verse num="24">And Judah came against the watchtower of the wilderness. And they looked at the crowd, and behold, corpses were lying on the ground. There was none <transChange type="added">who had</transChange> escaped.</verse>
    <verse num="25">When Jehoshaphat came with his people to plunder their booty, they found among them in abundance possessions, corpses, and precious items. And they took plunder for themselves {until they could carry no more}.<note>Literally "until not carrying"</note> And they were three days in plundering the booty, for it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> abundant.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And on the fourth day, they assembled in the Valley of Berakah, for there they blessed Yahweh. Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Berakah up to this day.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned, and Jehoshaphat <transChange type="added">was</transChange> at their head in returning to Jerusalem with joy, for Yahweh caused them to rejoice over their enemies.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And they came to Jerusalem with harps, stringed instruments, and trumpets to the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the earth when they heard that Yahweh had fought against the enemies of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="30">So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at rest, since his God gave rest to him all around. </verse>
    <verse num="31">So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. <transChange type="added">He was</transChange> thirty-five years old when he began to reign. And he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And he walked in the way of his father Asa and did not turn aside from it, to do what was right in the eyes of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Only the high places were not removed. The people still had not yet set their heart on the God of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="34">Now the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the first to the last, behold, they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> written in the chronicles<note>Or "words"</note> of Jehu the son of Hanani, which <transChange type="added">are</transChange> recorded in the scroll of the kings of Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="35">And afterward Jehoshaphat the king of Judah joined with Ahaziah the king of Israel, who acted wickedly.</verse>
    <verse num="36">He joined with him to build ships to go to Tarshish. And they built the ships in Ezion Geber.</verse>
    <verse num="37">Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because of your joining with Ahaziah, Yahweh will break down your works." And the ships were destroyed and were not able to go to Tarshish. </verse>

  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">And Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> and was buried with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> in the city of David, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now he had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these <transChange type="added">were</transChange> the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And their father gave to them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuables, with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, for he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the firstborn.</verse>
    <verse num="4">When Jehoram ascended to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and murdered all his brothers with the sword, and even some of the princes of Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Jehoram <transChange type="added">was</transChange> thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did evil in the sight of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But Yahweh was not willing to destroy the house of David on account of the covenant that he had {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> with David and since he had promised<note>Or "said"</note> to give a lamp to him and to his descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> {forever}.<note>Literally "all the days"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="8">In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they set up a king of their own.</verse>

    <verse num="10">So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah until this day. Then Libnah <transChange type="added">also</transChange> revolted at that time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Yahweh, the God of his ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="11">Moreover, he made high places in the hill country of Judah, and he enticed the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unfaithful, and he led Judah astray.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And a letter from Elijah the prophet came to him, saying, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father: 'Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father or in the ways of Asa, the king of Judah,</verse>

    <verse num="14">behold, Yahweh is inflicting a great plague on your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions,</verse>

    <verse num="20">He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the band of men who had come with the Arabs to the camp had murdered all the older sons. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, reigned.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Ahaziah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> forty-two<note>The Septuagint reads "twenty-two" here</note> years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem.

    <verse num="3">He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor for doing wickedness.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh as the house of Ahab <transChange type="added">had done</transChange>, for they were his counselors to his destruction after the death of his father.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He also walked in their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, to war against Hazael king of Aram<note>Or "Syria"</note> at Ramoth-Gilead. And the Arameans wounded Joram.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds he had suffered at Ramah, when he made war against Hazael king of Aram.<note>Or "Syria"</note> And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram son of Ahab in Jezreel for he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sick. </verse>
    <verse num="7">But the downfall of Ahaziah was from God, <transChange type="added">and intended</transChange> to come to Joram. And when he came, he went out with Jehoram to Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> when Jehu was judging the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah who ministered to Ahaziah, and he killed them.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he searched for Ahaziah and captured him. And he was hiding in Samaria. And they brought him to Jehu and put him to death. And they buried him, for they said, "He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the descendant<note>Or "son"; Ahaziah was Jehoshaphat's grandson</note> of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with his whole heart." And the house of Ahab had no one to exercise power over the kingdom. </verse>
    <verse num="10">Now <transChange type="added">when</transChange> Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son <transChange type="added">was</transChange> dead, she arose and murdered all the {royal descendants}<note>Literally "seed of the kingdom"</note> of the house of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But Jehosheba the daughter of the king took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and kidnapped him away from the sons of the king who were to be put to death.

So Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she was a sister of Ahaziah, hid him from before Athaliah so that she did not put him to death.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he was hidden with them in the house of God six years, but Athaliah reigned over the land. </verse>

  <chapter num="23">
    <verse num="1">And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself and took with him into a covenant <transChange type="added">relationship</transChange> the commanders of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zicri.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And they went around in Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And all the assembly {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, "Behold, the son of the king shall reign as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David.</verse>
    <verse num="4">This is the thing that you must do: one third of you priests and Levites {coming off duty on the Sabbath}<note>Literally "coming the Sabbath"</note> <transChange type="added">shall be</transChange> gatekeepers at the entrances,</verse>

    <verse num="6">Let no one enter into the house of Yahweh except the priests and the ministering Levites. They themselves may enter, for they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> holy, but all the people shall keep the requirements of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the Levites shall surround the king all around, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever comes into the house shall be put to death. You shall be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out." </verse>
    <verse num="8">And the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And they each took his men <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> {coming off duty on the Sabbath}<note>Literally "coming the Sabbath"</note> with {the ones going out to duty on the Sabbath},<note>Literally "going out the Sabbath"</note> for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the working groups.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Jehoiada the priest gave the spears and small shields that had belonged to King David that <transChange type="added">were in</transChange> the house of God to the commanders of hundreds.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he appointed all the people, each <transChange type="added">with</transChange> his weapon in his hand from the south side of the house to the north side of the house around the altar and the house.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then they brought out the son of the king and set upon him the crown and <transChange type="added">gave him</transChange> the statute and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, "{Long live the king}!"<note>Or "May the king live!"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="12">When Athaliah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And she looked and, behold, the king was standing by his column at the entrance, and the commanders and trumpeters beside the king, along with all the people of the land, rejoicing and blowing with trumpets, and the singers with the instruments of song leading the praise. And Athaliah tore her garments and cried, "Conspiracy! Conspiracy!"</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the commanders of the hundreds appointed over the troops, and he said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks, and whoever goes after her shall be put to death with the sword." For the priest had said, "You must not kill her in the house of Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they laid hands on her, and she went into the entrance of the Horse Gate of the house of the king, and they killed her there. </verse>
    <verse num="16">And Jehoiada {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they should be Yahweh's people.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then all the people went to the house of Baal and broke it down. And they smashed his altars and his images, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Jehoiada placed appointees <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the house of Yahweh under the hand of the Levitical priests whom David had allotted to the house of Yahweh to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh as was written in the law of Moses, with joy and with song, according to the {order of David}.<note>Literally "hands of David"</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">And he set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of Yahweh so that no person unclean with respect to any matter could enter.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he took the commanders of hundreds, the noblemen, the governors over the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of Yahweh. And they came through the upper gate <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the house of the king, and they set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet <transChange type="added">after</transChange> Athaliah had been killed with the sword. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="24">
    <verse num="1">Joash <transChange type="added">was</transChange> seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Zibiah from Beersheba.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Joash did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he fathered sons and daughters. </verse>
    <verse num="4">And afterward it was in the heart of Joash to repair the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="5">So he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, "Go out to the cities of Judah and gather money from all Israel to strengthen the house of your God sufficiently year by year. Now you yourselves must hasten to the matter." But the Levites did not act with haste.</verse>
    <verse num="6">So the king called Jehoiada the chief, and he said to him, "Why have you not required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax of Moses, the servant of Yahweh, and <transChange type="added">of</transChange> the assembly of Israel for the tent of the testimony?"</verse>
    <verse num="7">For the sons of the wicked Athaliah had broken into the house of God and had used all the holy vessels of the house of Yahweh for the Baals. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Then the king commanded, and they made a chest and put it at the gate outside the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And {they issued a proclamation}<note>Literally "they gave a voice"</note> in Judah and in Jerusalem to bring to Yahweh the tax <transChange type="added">that</transChange> Moses the servant of God <transChange type="added">had levied</transChange> upon Israel in the wilderness.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and they brought <transChange type="added">their tax</transChange> and threw <transChange type="added">it</transChange> into the chest until <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> finished.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And whenever he brought the chest to the appointee of the king by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> much money <transChange type="added">in it</transChange>, then the secretary of the king and the officer of the chief priest came and emptied the chest, then they took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh. And they hired stonemasons and skilled craftsmen to restore the house of Yahweh, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So those doing the work labored, and the restoration for the work made progress under their hand. And they restored the house of God to its position and strengthened it.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And when they had finished, they brought the remainder of the money before the king and Jehoiada, and they used it <transChange type="added">for</transChange> objects for the house of Yahweh, objects for the service and the burnt offerings, dishes, and objects of gold and silver. And they were offering burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh regularly, all the days of Jehoiada. </verse>
    <verse num="15">And Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and he died; <transChange type="added">he was</transChange> one hundred and thirty years old at his death.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And they buried him in the city of David with the kings, for he did good in Israel and with respect to God and his house. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And they forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> and served the Asherahs and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem on account of this guilt.</verse>
    <verse num="19">But he sent prophets among them, to bring them back to Yahweh. And they testified against them, and they did not obey. </verse>
    <verse num="20">Then the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood above the people and said to them, "Thus says God: 'Why are you transgressing the commandments of Yahweh so that you will not succeed? For you have forsaken Yahweh, so he will forsake you.'"</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then they conspired against him and stoned him <transChange type="added">with</transChange> stones at the command of the king in the courtyard of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="22">So King Joash did not remember the loyal love that Jehoiada had shown to him, and he killed his son. And as he was dying he said, "May Yahweh see and avenge!" </verse>
    <verse num="23">And it happened at the turn of the year <transChange type="added">that</transChange> the army of Aram<note>Or "Syria"</note> went up against him, and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the commanders of the people from among the people, and all the war booty they sent to the king of Damascus.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Though the army of Aram<note>Or "Syria"</note> came with few men, Yahweh gave a very large army into their hand, for they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> And they inflicted punishment on Joash. </verse>
    <verse num="25">And when they were going away from him (for they had left him with many wounds), his servants conspired against him on account of the blood of the sons<note>The Septuagint reads "son"</note> of Jehoiada the priest. So they killed him on his bed and he died. And they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him at the burial sites of the kings.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Now these <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath, the Ammonite, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith, the Moabite.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And <transChange type="added">as for</transChange> his sons, the many oracles against him, and <transChange type="added">his repair of</transChange> the foundation of the house of God, behold, they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> written in the story of the scroll of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="25">
    <verse num="1">Amaziah was twenty-five years old <transChange type="added">when</transChange> he became king. And he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Jehoaddan from Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, only not with a fully-devoted heart.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> as his reign was strengthened, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But he did not put their children to death, according to <transChange type="added">what</transChange> is written in the law, in the scroll of Moses, where Yahweh commanded, saying, "Fathers shall not be put to death on account of the sons, and the sons shall not be put to death on account of the fathers, but each shall be put to death for his own sin." </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Amaziah assembled <transChange type="added">the men of</transChange> Judah and set them by {families}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the</transChange> house of the fathers"</note> under commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin.

    <verse num="6">And he hired from Israel one hundred thousand strong, mighty warriors for one hundred talents. </verse>
    <verse num="7">But a man of God came to him, saying, "O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for Yahweh is not with Israel, all the Ephraimites.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But even still, you yourself go, do! Be strong for the battle <transChange type="added">else</transChange> God will make you stumble before the enemy! For there is power with God to help and to cause stumbling."</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Amaziah said to the man of God, "Now what <transChange type="added">should I</transChange> do with the one hundred talents that I have given to the troops of Israel?" And the man of God said, "{Yahweh is able to give}<note>Literally "There is to Yahweh to give"</note> to you more than this."</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Amaziah dismissed the troops that came to him from Ephraim to go to their home.<note>Or "their place"</note> And {they became very angry}<note>Literally "their noses became very hot"</note> with Judah, and they returned to their home {in great anger}.<note>Literally "in hotness of nose"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his army, he went <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the Valley of Salt. And he struck <transChange type="added">down</transChange> ten thousand men<note>Or "sons"</note> of Seir.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now the {troops}<note>Literally "the sons of the troop"</note> captured ten thousand <transChange type="added">others</transChange> alive, and they brought them to the top of the rock and threw them from the top of the rock. So all of them were smashed <transChange type="added">to pieces</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="13">As for the {troops}<note>Literally "sons of the troop"</note> Amaziah had sent back from going with him to war, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-Horon. And they struck <transChange type="added">down</transChange> three thousand of them and plundered much booty. </verse>
    <verse num="14">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> after Amaziah came <transChange type="added">back</transChange> from killing the Edomites, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, and he stood them up to himself as gods and bowed down before them and make smoke offerings for them.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So {Yahweh became very angry}<note>Literally "Yahweh's nose became very hot"</note> with Amaziah and sent a prophet to him, and he said to him, "Why have you sought the gods of the people who could not deliver their own people from your hand?"</verse>
    <verse num="16">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> while he was speaking to him, he said to him, "Have we appointed you as a counselor to the king? Stop--{why should you be killed}?"<note>Literally "why shall he strike you?"</note> So the prophet stopped and said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my advice." </verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel, and he sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come,<note>This translation follows the Qere reading</note> {let us face one another}.<note>Literally "let us look at faces"</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">And Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The thorn bush that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Lebanon has sent to the cedar which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as wife.' But a wild animal of the field that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thorn bush.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Look, you say <transChange type="added">that</transChange> you have struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up to boast. Now remain at your home. Why stir up disaster that you fall, you and Judah with you?" </verse>
    <verse num="20">But Amaziah did not listen, for it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> from God that he might give them into the hand <transChange type="added">of enemies</transChange>, because they sought the gods of Edom.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So Joash the king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah the king of Judah {faced one another}<note>Literally "looked at one another's faces"</note> at Beth-Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Judah was defeated before Israel, and each <transChange type="added">man</transChange> fled to his tent.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah the king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-Shemesh. And they brought him <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then with all the gold and silver, all the objects found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the storehouses of the house of the king, and {the hostages},<note>Literally "the sons of the pledges"</note> he returned to Samaria. </verse>
    <verse num="25">And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel, fifteen years.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Now the remainder of the words of Amaziah, <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the first <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the last, behold, are they not written in the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel?</verse>
    <verse num="27">And from the time that Amaziah turned away from Yahweh, they had plotted a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And they carried him on the horses and buried him with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> in the city of Judah. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="26">
    <verse num="1">Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah (now he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sixteen years old) and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He built Elath and returned it to Judah after the king slept with his ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">Uzziah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. And the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Yecoliah of Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he did what <transChange type="added">was</transChange> right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Amaziah his father had done.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he began to seek<note>Or "was seeking"</note> God in the days of Zechariah who was teaching in visions of God. And {whenever}<note>Literally "in the days"</note> he sought Yahweh God made him have success. </verse>
    <verse num="6">And he went out and made war against the Philistines, and he broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in Ashdod and among the Philistines.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who were living in Gur-Baal and Meunim.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah, and his fame<note>Or "name"</note> went out to the boundary<note>Literally "to coming in"</note> of Egypt, for he became {very strong}.<note>Literally "to above"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and he strengthened them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he built towers in the desert and hewed many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the Shephelah and on the plain, <transChange type="added">along with</transChange> farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Uzziah had troops {trained and ready for war}<note>Literally "making war, going out to fight"</note> in divisions according to the number of their enrollment at the hand of Jeuel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah of the king's commanders.</verse>
    <verse num="12">The whole number of the heads of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> for mighty warriors of strength <transChange type="added">was</transChange> two thousand six hundred.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And under their hand <transChange type="added">were</transChange> army troops <transChange type="added">numbering</transChange> three hundred and seven thousand five hundred who could make war with power and strength to help the king against an enemy.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Uzziah prepared small shields, spears, helmets, breastplates, bows, and slingstones for the whole army.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he made siege machines in Jerusalem designed <transChange type="added">by</transChange> skillful men to be <transChange type="added">set</transChange> upon the towers and upon the corners to shoot arrows and large slingstones. And his fame<note>Or "name"</note> went out far, for he helped marvelously, for he was strong. </verse>
    <verse num="16">But on account of his strength his heart grew proud unto destruction. And he acted unfaithfully against Yahweh his God and went into the temple of Yahweh to offer an incense offering on the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Azariah the priest, along with eighty strong priests with him, went in after him.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And they stood against King Uzziah and said to him, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> for the priests, the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully. There will be no honor for you from Yahweh God."</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then Uzziah, his censer in hand to burn incense, became angry. And when he became angry with the priests, then leprosy appeared on his forehead in front of the priests in the house of Yahweh at the altar of incense.</verse>
    <verse num="20">When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him, behold, he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> leprous in the forehead. So they rushed him away from there, and he also hastened to go out, for Yahweh had smitten him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So King Uzziah was leprous until the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house as a leper, for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh. And Jotham his son <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the house of the king, judging the people of the land. </verse>
    <verse num="22">Now the remainder of the words of Uzziah, <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the first <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Uzziah slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and they buried him with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> in the burial field which belonged to the kings, because, they said, "He <transChange type="added">was</transChange> leprous."

    <verse num="1">Jotham <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had done--only he did not go into the temple of Yahweh. But the people still acted corruptly.</verse>
    <verse num="3">He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and {he did much restoration}<note>Literally "he built much"</note> on the wall of Ophel.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built forts and towers in the wooded places.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now he fought with the king of the {Ammonites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> and prevailed against them. And the {Ammonites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> gave to him in that year one hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand <transChange type="added">measures of</transChange> barley. This <transChange type="added">is what</transChange> the {Ammonites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> rendered to him, as well as in the second and third year.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Jotham strengthened himself, for he established his ways before Yahweh his God. </verse>
    <verse num="7">Now the remainder of the words of Jotham and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="8">He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Jotham slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and they buried him in the city of David. And his son Ahaz became king in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="28">
    <verse num="1">Ahaz <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what is right in the eyes of Yahweh like David his ancestor.<note>Or "father"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made molten idols for the Baals.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he himself burned incense in the valley of Ben-Hinnom and burned his sons in the fire, according to the detestable <transChange type="added">practices</transChange> of the nations whom Yahweh drove out before the Israelites.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops, and under every flourishing tree. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Yahweh his God gave him into the hand of the king of Aram<note>Or "Syria"</note> who defeated him and captured many captives from him and brought <transChange type="added">them to</transChange> Damascus. Moreover, he was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, and he defeated him by a great attack.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Pekah, the son of Remaliah, killed in one day one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah, all men of strength, because they forsook Yahweh the God of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">And Zikri, a mighty warrior of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the son of the king, Azrikam the commander of the house, and Elkanah the second to the king.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the Israelites captured two hundred thousand of their brothers, women, sons, and daughters. And they also plundered much booty from them and brought the booty to Samaria. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Now a prophet of Yahweh was there; Oded <transChange type="added">was</transChange> his name. And he went out before the army that was coming to Samaria and said to them, "Look, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> on account of the anger of Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> against Judah <transChange type="added">that</transChange> he gave them into your hands, and you killed them in a rage reaching to the heavens.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So now, you yourselves plan to subdue people of Judah and Jerusalem as slaves and female servants for yourselves. {Is there not also guilt on your part}<note>Literally "Is there not only you with yourselves guilt?"</note> against Yahweh your God?</verse>
    <verse num="11">So now, listen to me and return the captives of your brothers whom you have taken captive, for the fierce anger of Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> against you." </verse>
    <verse num="12">Then men from the heads of Ephraim--Azariah the son of Jehohanan, Berekiah the son of Meshillemoth, Hezekiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai--stood against those returning from the fight.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And they said to them, "You shall not bring the captives here, for <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> as guilt <transChange type="added">against</transChange> Yahweh upon us. You yourselves plan to add to our sins and to our guilt, but our guilt is very great, and <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> great anger against Israel."</verse>
    <verse num="14">So the soldiers left the captives and the plunder before the commanders and all the assembly.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then the men designated by name arose and took the captives and from the plunder clothed all their nakedness. So they clothed them, gave them sandals, gave them food to eat, gave them water to drink, anointed them, and guided them with the donkeys <transChange type="added">provided</transChange> for all those who stumbled, and brought them to Jericho, the city of the palm trees, next to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria. </verse>
    <verse num="16">At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria to help him,</verse>
    <verse num="17">since again the Edomites came and struck against Judah and took captives.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the Philistines sent raids into the cities of the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah. And they captured Beth-Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Socoh with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages. And they settled there.</verse>
    <verse num="19">For Yahweh subdued Judah for the sake of Ahaz, king of Israel, for he created disorder in Judah and acted unfaithfully against Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Tiglath-Pileser<note>The Hebrew reads "Tilgath-Pilneser"</note> the king of Assyria came against him and brought trouble for him, {instead of helping him},<note>Literally "and did not strengthen him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">for Ahaz took a portion <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the house of Yahweh and the house of the king and the princes, and he gave <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to the king of Assyria, but it was no help to him. </verse>
    <verse num="22">And in the time of his distress, King Ahaz continued to act unfaithfully against Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="23">He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and said, "Because the gods of the king of Aram<note>Or "Syria"</note> helped them, I will sacrifice to them so that they will help me." But they were {a disaster}<note>Literally "a cause of stumbling"</note> to him and to all Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then Ahaz gathered the objects of the house of God, and he cut the objects of the house of God to pieces. And he shut the doors of the house of Yahweh and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And {in every city}<note>Literally "in all city and city"</note> of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and he provoked Yahweh, the God of his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> to anger. </verse>
    <verse num="26">Now the remainder of his words and all his ways, <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the first <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the last, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Ahaz slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him to the burial site of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son became king in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="29">
    <verse num="1">Hezekiah became king when he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Abijah the daughter of Zechariah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done. </verse>
    <verse num="3">In the first year of his kingship, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Yahweh and strengthened them.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and he gathered them into the eastern square.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he said to them, "Hear me, O Levites! Sanctify yourselves now, and sanctify the house of Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and bring out the defilement from the sanctuary.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For our ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> acted unfaithfully and did evil in the sight of Yahweh our God, and have forsaken him and turned away their faces from the dwelling place of Yahweh. {They have turned their backs}<note>Literally "And they have given back"</note> <transChange type="added">on it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="7">They also shut the doors of the portico and extinguished the lamps. And they did not burn incense or offer burnt offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the wrath of Yahweh was upon Judah and Jerusalem. And he made them as an abhorrence, as a desolation and an object of scorn, as you see with your own eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Now behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in captivity on account of this.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now {it is in my heart}<note>Literally "with my heart"</note> to {make}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger might turn away from him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Now, my sons, do not be negligent, for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him to serve him and to be his servants and incense burners." </verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the Levites arose--Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from the Kohathites; and Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel from the Merarites; and Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah, from the Gershonites.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And from the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeiel; and from the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah;</verse>
    <verse num="14">and from the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Heman: Jeiel and Shimei; and from the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel--</verse>
    <verse num="15">and they gathered their brothers and sanctified themselves, and they went in according to the command of the king because of the words of Yahweh, to purify the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the priests went into the inner <transChange type="added">part</transChange> of the house of Yahweh to purify <transChange type="added">it</transChange>. And they brought out all the impurity that they found in the temple of Yahweh <transChange type="added">out</transChange> to the courtyard of the house of Yahweh. And the Levites took <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to bring <transChange type="added">them</transChange> outside to the Wadi<note>Or "valley"; a wadi is a valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> Kidron.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And they began to sanctify themselves on the first day of the first month. And on the eighth day of the month they came to the portico of Yahweh. And they sanctified the house of Yahweh for eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And they went into the inner <transChange type="added">part</transChange> to King Hezekiah and said, "We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh: the altar of burnt offering, all its objects, the table of the rows <transChange type="added">of bread</transChange> and all its objects,</verse>
    <verse num="19">and all the objects that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he sinned, we have prepared and sanctified. Look, they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> before the altar of Yahweh." </verse>
    <verse num="20">Then King Hezekiah rose early and gathered the officials of the city, and he went up to the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a purification offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Aaron, the priests, to offer <transChange type="added">them</transChange> on the altar of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And they slaughtered the cattle, and the priests received the blood and threw it toward the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and threw the blood toward the altar, and then they slaughtered the lambs and threw the blood toward the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then they brought the goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid hands upon them.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the priest killed them and offered their blood against the altar to make atonement for all Israel, for the king had commanded the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="25">And he stood the Levites <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the house of Yahweh with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the command of David and Gad, the seer of the king, and Nathan the prophet, for the command <transChange type="added">was</transChange> by the hand of Yahweh by the hand of his prophets.</verse>
    <verse num="26">When the Levites stood with the objects of David and the priests with the trumpets,</verse>
    <verse num="27">Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And at the time the burnt offering began, the song of Yahweh began, and also the trumpets, at the hands of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> instruments of David king of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then all the assembly bowed down, and the song was sung, and the trumpeters trumpeted--all <transChange type="added">together</transChange> until the end of the burnt offering.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And when the offering was finished, the king and all who were found with him knelt down and bowed themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then King Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to praise Yahweh with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they offered praise with joy, and they bowed down and worshiped. </verse>
    <verse num="31">Then Hezekiah answered and said, "Now {you have consecrated yourselves}<note>Literally "you have filled your hands"</note> to Yahweh. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of Yahweh!" And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> willing in heart <transChange type="added">brought</transChange> burnt offerings.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And the number of burnt offerings that the assembly brought was seventy cattle, one hundred rams, two hundred lambs--all these <transChange type="added">were</transChange> to offer to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And the consecrated offerings of cattle <transChange type="added">were</transChange> six hundred cattle and three thousand sheep.</verse>
    <verse num="34">But the priests were too few, and they were not able to offer all the burnt offerings, so their brothers, the Levites, strengthened them to finish the work, and until the <transChange type="added">rest of</transChange> the priests consecrated themselves. (For the Levites <transChange type="added">were</transChange> {more conscientious}<note>Literally "more upright of heart"</note> to sanctify themselves than the priests.)</verse>
    <verse num="35">And beside the many burnt offerings <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the fat of the peace offerings and the libations for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of Yahweh was established.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had established with the people, for the matter happened suddenly. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="30">
    <verse num="1">Then Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, to come to the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem to make a Passover feast to Yahweh the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now the king and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to make the Passover feast in the second month--</verse>
    <verse num="3">but they were not able to make it at that time, for the priests had not consecrated themselves {in sufficient numbers},<note>Literally "for enough"</note> and the people had not been assembled in Jerusalem--</verse>
    <verse num="4">and the plan seemed right in the eyes of the king and in the eyes of all the assembly.</verse>
    <verse num="5">So they let the decree stand, {to make a proclamation}<note>Literally "to spread a voice"</note> throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, to come to make a Passover feast to Yahweh the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the runners went with the letter from the hand of the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah according to the command of the king, saying, "O sons of Israel, return to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Do not be like your fathers and like your brothers, who acted unfaithfully before Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> so that he made them as a desolation, as you see.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Now, do not stiffen your neck as your fathers,<note>Or "ancestors"</note> but give a hand to Yahweh and come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever, and serve Yahweh your God that his fierce anger may turn away from you.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For when you return to Yahweh, your brothers and your children <transChange type="added">will find</transChange> compassion before their captors and return to this land, for Yahweh your God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> gracious and compassionate, and he will not turn away his face from you if you return to him." </verse>
    <verse num="10">And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> the runners were passing from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and up to Zebulun, but they were laughing at them and mocking them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Only men from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="12">The hand of God was also upon Judah, to give them one heart to obey the command of the king and the princes concerning the word of Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="13">So many people gathered in Jerusalem to hold the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month; <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> a very great assembly.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they rose up and removed the altars that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in Jerusalem. And they removed all the incense altars and threw <transChange type="added">them</transChange> away in the Wadi<note>Or "valley"; a wadi is a valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> Kidron.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were disgraced, so they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then they stood at their positions according to custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests were sprinkling the blood from the hand of the Levites.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For <transChange type="added">there were</transChange> many in the assembly who did not consecrate themselves, so the Levites <transChange type="added">were</transChange> over the killing of the Passover sacrifices for all who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not clean, to consecrate <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For a majority of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves. But they ate the Passover sacrifice {otherwise than prescribed},<note>Literally "in not as it is written"</note> but Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, "May the good Yahweh make atonement unto</verse>
    <verse num="19">everyone whose heart is set to seek God, Yahweh the God of his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> though not according to the cleansing for the sanctuary."</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and he healed the people.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> who were found in Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy. And the Levites and the priests were offering praise to Yahweh day by day, with powerful instruments to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites {who were skilled at service}<note>Literally "who were showing good understanding"</note> to Yahweh. So they ate the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and giving thanks to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="23">Then the whole assembly decided to make seven more days <transChange type="added">of feasting</transChange>, so they made seven <transChange type="added">more</transChange> days with joy,</verse>
    <verse num="24">for Hezekiah the king of Judah had {provided}<note>Literally "lifted up"</note> one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the assembly, and the princes {provided}<note>Literally "lifted up"</note> one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep for the assembly. And many priests consecrated themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And the whole assembly of Judah, the priests and the Levites, all the assembly who had come from the land of Israel, and those living in Judah rejoiced.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And there was great joy in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there was nothing such as this in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy dwelling place in the heavens. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="31">
    <verse num="1">And when all this was finished, all Israel who were found in the cities of Judah went out and shattered the stone pillars, cut down the Asherahs, and destroyed the high places and the altars from all Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh {to the very last one}.<note>Literally "until finishing"</note> Then all the Israelites returned, each to his own property <transChange type="added">and</transChange> to their cities. </verse>
    <verse num="2">And Hezekiah appointed working groups of the priests and the Levites, each according to their divisions, {according to the service for priests and Levites},<note>Literally "according to the mouth of his service, for priests and Levites"</note> for burnt offerings, for peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camps of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the gift of the king <transChange type="added">was</transChange> out of his own possessions for the burnt offerings--the burnt offerings for the morning and the evening and for Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and appointed feasts, as is written in the law of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then he said to the people, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to give a gift for the priests and the Levites, so that they might be strong in the law of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the word spread. The Israelites gave abundantly <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the firstfruits of grain, new wine, olive oil, honey, and all <transChange type="added">kinds of</transChange> grains from the field. And they brought tithes of everything in abundance.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the people of Israel and Judah who were living in the cities of Judah, they also brought a tithe of cattle and sheep and a tithe of consecrated objects to Yahweh their God. And they gave heaps <transChange type="added">upon</transChange> heaps.</verse>
    <verse num="7">In the third month the heaps began to pile up, and in the seventh month they ceased.</verse>
    <verse num="8">When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh and his people Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Hezekiah questioned<note>Or "sought"</note> the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, saying, "Since the offerings began to be brought to the house of Yahweh, <transChange type="added">we have</transChange> eaten and been satisfied, and have much to spare, for Yahweh has blessed his people. Now <transChange type="added">see</transChange> this abundant remainder!" </verse>
    <verse num="11">And Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh, and they were prepared.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then they brought the offerings and tithes and holy objects faithfully. And over them <transChange type="added">as</transChange> leader <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Conaniah the Levite. And Shimei his brother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> second <transChange type="added">in rank</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Jehiel, Azaziah, Nathan, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah <transChange type="added">were</transChange> chief officers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei, his brother, by appointment of King Hezekiah. And Azaraiah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> leader of the house of God.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Now Kore the son of Imlah, the Levite, the gatekeeper of the east gate <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the freewill offerings of God, to give offerings to Yahweh and the most holy things.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And at his hand <transChange type="added">were</transChange> Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests <transChange type="added">and</transChange> {entrusted}<note>Literally "in faithfulness"</note> to give to their brothers by working groups, according to the eldest <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the youngest,</verse>
    <verse num="16">besides their enrollment by genealogy, to males from three years old and upward, to all who came into the house of Yahweh, {as each day required}<note>Literally "for the word of the day by his day"</note> for their service in their posts according to their working groups.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the enrollment of the priests <transChange type="added">was</transChange> according to the house of their fathers, and the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, according to their posts by their working groups.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And <transChange type="added">they were</transChange> enrolled with all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters for the whole assembly because of their faithfulness. And they sanctified themselves in holiness.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And for the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Aaron, the priests, <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> in the fields of the pasturelands of their cities, {in each and every one of their cities}<note>Literally "in every city and the city"</note> <transChange type="added">were</transChange> men who were designated by name to give shares to every male among the priests and to everyone enrolled among the Levites. </verse>
    <verse num="20">And Hezekiah did according to this throughout all Judah. And he did what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good and what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> right and what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> faithful before Yahweh his God.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God or with respect to the law and the commandment to seek his God, he did with all his heart, and he prospered. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="32">
    <verse num="1">After these things and these <transChange type="added">acts of</transChange> faithfulness, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came, and he came against Judah. And he encamped against the fortified cities and planned to break them down for himself.</verse>
    <verse num="2">When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and <transChange type="added">that</transChange> his face <transChange type="added">was set</transChange> for battle against Jerusalem,</verse>
    <verse num="3">he took counsel with his commanders and his mighty warriors to block off the waters of the springs that <transChange type="added">came</transChange> from outside the city, and they helped him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then many people were gathered, and they blocked off all the springs and the river that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?"</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then he strengthened himself and built up all the walls that were broken down, and raised towers upon <transChange type="added">them</transChange> and another wall {outside}.<note>Literally "toward the street"</note> And he strengthened the Millo of the city of David and made much weaponry and small shields.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he appointed commanders for battle over the people and gathered them to himself into the public square of the gate of the city. And he spoke to their hearts, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="7">"Be strong! Be courageous! Do not fear and do not be dismayed before the king of Assyria and before all the crowd that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with him, for <transChange type="added">there are</transChange> more with us than with him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">With him <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the arm of flesh, and with us <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Yahweh our God, to help us and to fight our battles." And the people took confidence with the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah. </verse>
    <verse num="9">After this Sennacherib the king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (now he and all his armies with him <transChange type="added">were</transChange> against Lachish) to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all of Judah that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="10">"Thus says Sennacherib the king of Assyria: 'On what <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you relying that <transChange type="added">you are</transChange> dwelling in siege works in Jerusalem?</verse>
    <verse num="11">Is not Hezekiah urging you to give you <transChange type="added">up</transChange> to die by starvation and thirst, saying, "Yahweh our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria"?</verse>
    <verse num="12">Has not Hezekiah himself removed his high places and his altars and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, "You must bow down before one altar and upon it you must make offerings"?</verse>
    <verse num="13">Do you not know what I have done, I and my ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of all the lands at all able to save their land from my hand?</verse>
    <verse num="14">Who among all the gods of those nations whom my ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> utterly destroyed was able to save his people from my hand, that your God will be able to save you from my hand?</verse>
    <verse num="15">So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you. Do not let him urge you according to this. Do not put trust in him, for no god of any nation and kingdom has been able to save his people from my hand and from the hand of my ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> Surely then your God will not save you from my hand!'" </verse>
    <verse num="16">And still more his servants said against Yahweh God and against Hezekiah his servant.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he wrote letters to treat Yahweh the God of Israel with contempt and spoke against him, saying, "As the gods of the nations of the earth who did not save their people from my hand, so likewise the God of Hezekiah will not save his people from my hand."</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then they called with a great voice in Judean to the people of Jerusalem who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> upon the wall to frighten them and terrify them, so that they could take the city captive.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And they spoke about the God of Jerusalem as about the gods of the peoples of the earth, the works of the hands of humankind. </verse>
    <verse num="20">Then King Hezekiah and Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, prayed concerning this. And they cried to the heavens.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Yahweh sent an angel, and he destroyed every mighty warrior of strength, commander, and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria. And he returned with shamed face to his land and went into the house of his god. And some of the offspring of his loins fell upon him there with the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="22">So Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, and from the all <transChange type="added">their enemies</transChange>, and gave them rest all around.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And many brought tribute to Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations thereafter. </verse>
    <verse num="24">In those days Hezekiah fell ill unto death, and he prayed to Yahweh. And he answered him and gave him a sign.</verse>
    <verse num="25">But Hezekiah did not reciprocate according to the benefit <transChange type="added">placed</transChange> upon him, because his heart became proud. So wrath was upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="26">But Hezekiah humbled himself with respect to the arrogance of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah. </verse>
    <verse num="27">And Hezekiah had very much wealth and honor, and he made storehouses for himself for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, small shields, and all <transChange type="added">sorts of</transChange> desirable objects;</verse>
    <verse num="28">and storage buildings for the yield of grain, new wine, and olive oil; and animal stalls for all <transChange type="added">kinds of</transChange> animals, and animals and herds for animal stalls.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And he made cities for himself, and livestock of sheep and abundant cattle, for God had given to him very abundant possessions.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And this same Hezekiah blocked off the flow of the waters of the upper Gihon, and directed them down the west <transChange type="added">side</transChange> of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And thus <transChange type="added">in the matter of</transChange> the envoys of the commanders of Babylon who had been sent to him to seek the sign that had happened in the land, God forsook him, to test him <transChange type="added">and</transChange> to know all <transChange type="added">that was</transChange> in his heart. </verse>
    <verse num="32">Now the remainder of the words of Hezekiah and his loyal love, behold, they are written in the visions of Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And Hezekiah slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and they buried him in the upper <transChange type="added">part</transChange> of the burial sites of the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of David. And all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son became king in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="33">
    <verse num="1">Manasseh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to the detestable things of the nations whom Yahweh drove out before the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">And {he rebuilt}<note>Literally "returned and built"</note> the high places that Hezekiah his father broke down, and he set up altars for the Baals, made Asherahs, and bowed down to the host of heaven and served them.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he built altars in the house of Yahweh, <transChange type="added">of</transChange> which Yahweh had said, "In Jerusalem my name shall be forever."</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he built altars to all the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he himself burned his sons in the fire in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom. And he practiced sorcery and divination, and he engaged in witchcraft and dealt with mediums and spiritists. And he did much evil in the eyes of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he placed the carved image of the idol that he had made in the house of God, <transChange type="added">of</transChange> which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I will {never}<note>Literally "not continue to"</note> remove the foot of Israel from upon the land that I appointed to your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> if only you will take care to do all that I have commanded them, all the law, the regulations, and the judgments by the hand of Moses."</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do evil more than the nations that Yahweh destroyed before the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="10">And Yahweh spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they would not listen.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So Yahweh brought the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria upon them, and they took Manasseh captive with hooks, and they bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And when he was in distress he entreated Yahweh his God and greatly humbled himself before the God of his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="13">and prayed to him. And God responded to him and heard his plea and let him return to Jerusalem to his kingdom. And Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God. </verse>
    <verse num="14">Then afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of the Gihon in the valley, and for the entrance into the Gate of the Fishes. And it encircled the Ophel and raised it very high. Then he placed strong commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he removed the foreign gods and the carved image from the house of Yahweh and all the altars which he built on the mountain of the house of Yahweh and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside the city.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he restored the altar of Yahweh and offered sacrifices of peace offerings and thank offerings upon it. And he commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Nevertheless, the people offered at the high places, but only to Yahweh their God. </verse>
    <verse num="18">Now the remainder of the words of Manasseh and his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in the words of the kings of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And his prayer, and <transChange type="added">how</transChange> he<note>That is, God</note> responded to him, all his sin and his unfaithful acts, and the places where he built the high places and set up Asherahs and idols before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the words of the seers. </verse>
    <verse num="20">And Manasseh slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and they buried him in his house. And Amon his son became king in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Amon <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And he did what <transChange type="added">was</transChange> evil in the eyes of Yahweh as Manasseh his father had done. And Amon sacrificed to all the idols that Manasseh his father had made, and he served them.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he did not humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father humbled himself, but Amon himself multiplied <transChange type="added">his</transChange> guilt.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his house.</verse>
    <verse num="25">But the people of the land struck down all who conspired against King Amon. And the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="34">
    <verse num="1">Josiah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in the ways of David his ancestor<note>Or "father"</note> and did not deviate <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the right or <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the left.</verse>
    <verse num="3">In the eighth year of his reign, while he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> still a boy, he began to seek the God of David his ancestor.<note>Or "father"</note> And in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherahs, the idols, and the images.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he destroyed before him the altars for the Baals, and he cut down the incense stands above them. And the Asherahs, the idols, and the images he smashed. And he ground <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to powder and sprinkled <transChange type="added">the dust</transChange> over the burial sites of those who sacrificed to them.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he burned the bones of the priests on the altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, in their ruins all around,</verse>
    <verse num="7">he broke down the altars and the Asherahs and crushed the idols, grinding <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to dust, and he cut down all the incense stands in all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Now in the eighteenth year of his reign <transChange type="added">after</transChange> he purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the commander of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his God.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they came to Hilkiah the high priest and gave the money that was brought for the house of God, which the Levites, the guardians of the threshold, had gathered from the hand of Manasseh, Ephraim, and from the whole remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And they delivered <transChange type="added">it</transChange> into the hand of the workmen who were appointed in the house of Yahweh, and they <transChange type="added">in turn</transChange> gave it to those doing the work who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> at work in the house of Yahweh, to repair <transChange type="added">and</transChange> restore the house.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And they dispensed<note>Or "gave"</note> <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to the skilled craftsmen and the builders to buy stone <transChange type="added">for</transChange> hewing and timber for the seams and for binding the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the men did the work faithfully. Over them as supervisors <transChange type="added">were</transChange> appointed Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites from the Merarites, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Kohathites.

    <verse num="13"><transChange type="added">were</transChange> over the porters and were directing all who worked {on each task}.<note>Literally "for service and service"</note> And some of the Levites <transChange type="added">were</transChange> scribes, officials, and gatekeepers. </verse>
    <verse num="14">And when they brought out the money that had been brought <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found a scroll of the law of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found a scroll of the law in the house of Yahweh!" Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Shaphan brought the scroll to the king and {also informed}<note>Literally "returned again a word to"</note> the king, saying, "All that was put into the hand of your servants they are doing.</verse>
    <verse num="17">They have dispensed<note>Or "emptied out"</note> the money which was found in the house of Yahweh and have put it into the hand of the overseers and those doing the work."</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, "Hilkiah the priest gave to me a scroll." Then Shaphan read from it before the king.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And when the king heard the words of the law, he tore his garments,</verse>
    <verse num="20">and the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="22">Then Hilkiah and those whom the king <transChange type="added">had sent</transChange> went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, son of Tikvath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the garments.

    <verse num="23">And she said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: 'Say to the man who sent you all to me:</verse>

    <verse num="26">But to the king of Judah who sent you to seek Yahweh, thus shall you say to him: 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: <transChange type="added">As for</transChange> the words which you heard,</verse>

    <verse num="28">'Behold, I will gather you to your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see any of the disaster that I am bringing upon this place.'" '" </verse>
    <verse num="29">Then they sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to the king, and he gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And the king went up to the house of Yahweh with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with the priests and the Levites--all the people from great to small--and they read in their ears all the words of the scroll of the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And the king stood at his position. And he made the covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh and to keep his commands and statutes and regulations with all his heart and with all his soul, to do the words of the covenant that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> written on this scroll.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then he obligated<note>Or "stood"</note> all who were found in Jerusalem and in Benjamin, that the inhabitants of Jerusalem would do according to the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="33">And Josiah removed all the detestable things from the whole land that belonged to the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> and obligated<note>Or "made"</note> all who were found in Israel to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they did not turn aside from following<note>Or "after"</note> Yahweh, the God of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> </verse>

  <chapter num="35">
    <verse num="1">Josiah kept<note>Or "made"</note> the Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem. And they slaughtered the Passover <transChange type="added">sacrifice</transChange> on the fourteenth day of the first month.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he set the priests at their posts and encouraged them in the service of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he said to the Levites who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> teaching all Israel, who were sanctified to Yahweh, "Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. There is no <transChange type="added">need</transChange> to carry it on <transChange type="added">your</transChange> shoulders. Now serve Yahweh your God and his people Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And prepare yourselves according to {your families},<note>Literally "the house of your fathers"</note> according to your working groups, according to the decree<note>Or "writing"</note> of David king of Israel and according to the decree<note>Or "writing"</note> of Solomon his son.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And stand in the sanctuary according to the clans of {your families}<note>Literally "the house of your fathers"</note> for your brothers, the {lay people},<note>Literally "sons of the people"</note> and a part of the {family}<note>Literally "house of the father"</note> of the Levites.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And slaughter the Passover <transChange type="added">lamb</transChange> and consecrate yourself and prepare for your brothers to do according to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Moses. </verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Josiah provided for the {lay people}<note>Literally "sons of the people"</note> sheep, lambs, and young goats, all for the Passover for all who were found <transChange type="added">there</transChange>, to the sum of thirty thousand, along with three thousand bulls. These <transChange type="added">were</transChange> the possession of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And his officials contributed a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, commanders of the house of God, gave to the priests two thousand six hundred Passover <transChange type="added">lambs</transChange> and three hundred bulls.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jehozabad, commanders of the Levites, contributed to the Levites five thousand Passover <transChange type="added">lambs</transChange> and five hundred bulls. </verse>
    <verse num="10">And when the work had been completed, the priests stood at their positions and the Levites in their working groups according to the command of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And they slaughtered the Passover <transChange type="added">lamb</transChange>, and the priests sprinkled <transChange type="added">the blood</transChange> from their hand, and the Levites flayed <transChange type="added">the sacrifices</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And they set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the clans of the {families}<note>Literally "house of the fathers"</note> for the {lay people},<note>Literally "sons of the people"</note> to offer to Yahweh according to what is written in the scroll of Moses. And thus they did with the bulls.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then they roasted the Passover <transChange type="added">lamb</transChange> in the fire according to the ordinance. And they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in kettles, and in dishes and brought it quickly to the {lay people}.<note>Literally "sons of the people"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, since the priests, the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Aaron, <transChange type="added">were busy</transChange> with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night. So the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Aaron.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the singers, the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Asaph, <transChange type="added">were</transChange> at their stations according to the decree<note>Or "command"</note> of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, the seer of the king. And the gatekeepers <transChange type="added">were</transChange> at {each gate}.<note>Literally "gate to gate"</note> They did not need to depart from their service, for their brothers the Levites had made preparations for them. </verse>
    <verse num="16">So all the service of Yahweh was prepared on that day to keep<note>Or "make"</note> the Passover and to sacrifice burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh, according to the command of King Josiah.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the Israelites who were present kept<note>Or "made"</note> the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And there was no Passover like it kept<note>Or "made"</note> in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. And none of the kings of Israel kept<note>Or "made"</note> a Passover like that which Josiah and the priests and the Levites, and all of Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, kept.<note>Or "made"</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.<note>Or "made"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="20">After all of this that Josiah had prepared <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the temple,<note>Or "house"</note> Neco the king of Egypt went up to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went up to meet him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And he<note>That is, Neco</note> sent messengers to him, saying, "{What is there between us},<note>Literally "What to me and to you"</note> O king of Judah? <transChange type="added">I am</transChange> not against you yourself this day, but against the house making war against me. And God has commanded me to make haste. Stop <transChange type="added">opposing</transChange> God, who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with me that he will not destroy you."</verse>
    <verse num="22">But Josiah did not turn his face from him, but he disguised himself to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and he went out to fight in the plain of Megiddo.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am badly wounded."</verse>
    <verse num="24">So his servants took him out of the chariot and transported him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the burial sites of his ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned over Josiah.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Jeremiah uttered a lament for Josiah, and all the male and female singers have spoken in their laments about Josiah to this day. And they made them a requirement in Israel, and behold, they are written in the laments. </verse>
    <verse num="26">Now the remainder of the words of Josiah and his loyal love <transChange type="added">for</transChange> what is written in the law of Yahweh</verse>
    <verse num="27">and his words, <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the first <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the last, behold, they are written in the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. </verse>

  <chapter num="36">
    <verse num="1">And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and made him king in place of his father in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Jehoahaz <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid a tribute upon the land <transChange type="added">of</transChange> one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and he changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz his brother and brought him to Egypt. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Jehoiakim <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh his God.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon went up against him, and he bound him with bronze fetters to bring him to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Nebuchadnezzar brought to Babylon the objects of the house of Yahweh and put them into the temple in Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Now the remainder of the words of Jehoiakim and the detestable things that he did and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Jehoiachin <transChange type="added">was</transChange> eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And at the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with objects of the treasure of the house of Yahweh. And he made Zedekiah his brother king in Judah and Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Zedekiah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet {who spoke for}<note>Literally "from the mouth of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="14">All the leaders of the priests and the people likewise increased in unfaithfulness according to all the detestable things of the nations. And they polluted the house of Yahweh that he had consecrated in Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse num="15">And Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> had repeatedly and persistently sent to them by the hand of his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place.</verse>
    <verse num="16">But they were mocking the messengers of God and despising his words and scoffing at his prophets until the wrath of Yahweh rose against his people until there was no remedy. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Therefore he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, and he killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary. He showed no mercy on a young man, a virgin, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> elderly, or decrepit. He delivered all into his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, the storehouses of the house of Yahweh, and the storehouses of the king and his princes, these all he brought to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And they burned the house of God. And they shattered the walls of Jerusalem and burned its citadels with fire and destroyed all the vessels of its treasuries.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he took {those who escaped the sword}<note>Literally "the remainder from the sword"</note> to Babylon. And they became servants to him and to his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia,</verse>
    <verse num="21">to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land has enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days of desolation it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years. </verse>
    <verse num="22">And in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, so that he {made a proclamation}<note>Literally "extended a voice"</note> throughout all his kingdom and also in writing, saying:</verse>
    <verse num="23">"Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia: 'Yahweh the God of heaven has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has appointed me to build a house for him at Jerusalem, which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Judah.
