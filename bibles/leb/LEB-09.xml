  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">There was a certain man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.<note>Or "Ephrathite"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">He had two wives; the name of the first <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Hannah, and the name of the second <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Now this man used to go up from his town {year by year}<note>Literally "from days to days"</note> to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of hosts in Shiloh, {where}<note>Literally "and there"</note> the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, <transChange type="added">were</transChange> priests to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="4">{On}<note>Literally "And it happened on"</note> the day Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But to Hannah he would give {a double portion},<note>Literally "a portion of two faces"</note> because he loved Hannah, though Yahweh had closed her womb.</verse>
    <verse num="6">(Now her rival wife would provoke her severely in order to upset her because Yahweh had closed her womb.)</verse>
    <verse num="7">And so he used to do<note>So Hebrew; because of the abrupt change of subject some revocalize the verb to read "it used to be"</note> year after year; {whenever}<note>Or "as often as"; literally "from enough"</note> she went up to the house of Yahweh, she<note>That is, Penninah</note> would provoke her so that she<note>That is, Hannah</note> would weep and would not eat.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So Elkanah her husband would say to her: "Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat? And {why are you heartsick}?<note>Literally "why <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your heart evil"</note> Am I not better to you than ten sons?"</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Hannah got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh. (Now Eli the priest <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the temple<note>This is not the temple of Solomon (ca. 966 bc), but rather the tabernacle that first resided at Shiloh after the conquest of Joshua.</note> of Yahweh.)</verse>
    <verse num="10">She <transChange type="added">was</transChange> {deeply troubled},<note>Literally "bitter of soul"</note> so she prayed to Yahweh and wept bitterly.</verse>
    <verse num="11">She {made a vow}<note>Literally "vowed a vow"</note> and said: "O Yahweh of hosts, if you will look with compassion on the misery of your female servant, and will remember me, and not forget your female servant, and will give to your female servant {a male child}<note>Literally "an offspring of men"</note> then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and a razor will never pass over his head."<note>"A razor will never pass over his head" indicates that Hannah promised to dedicate her son to Yahweh as a Nazirite, according to the terms of Num 6:1-21</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">{While}<note>Literally "And it happened that when"</note> she continued to pray before Yahweh, Eli was observing her mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Now Hannah had been speaking in her heart; her lips <transChange type="added">were</transChange> moving, but her voice could not be heard, so Eli considered her <transChange type="added">to be</transChange> drunk.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Eli said to her, "How long will you behave like someone <transChange type="added">who is</transChange> drunk? Put away your wine!"</verse>
    <verse num="15">But Hannah answered and said, "No, my lord. I am a woman {deeply distressed},<note>Literally "difficult of spirit"</note> but I have not drunk wine <transChange type="added">or</transChange> strong drink. <transChange type="added">Rather</transChange>, I have poured out my soul before Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Do not regard your female servant as {worthless},<note>Literally "as a daughter of Belial/daughter of worthlessness"</note> but because of the extent of my worries and my provocation I have spoken all of this."</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have asked of him."</verse>
    <verse num="18">And she said, "May your female slave find favor in your sight." Then the woman went on her way and ate <transChange type="added">something</transChange>, and {her face did not look sad any longer}.<note>Literally "her faces were not for her <transChange type="added">any</transChange> longer"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="19">Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before Yahweh {and returned}<note>Literally "and they returned and went"</note> to their house at Ramah. Then Elkanah {had sexual relations with}<note>Literally "knew"</note> Hannah his wife, and Yahweh remembered her.</verse>
    <verse num="20">{In due time},<note>Literally "At the turning of the days"</note> Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She called his name Samuel, for <transChange type="added">she said</transChange>, "I requested him from Yahweh." </verse>
    <verse num="21">So the man Elkanah went up with all his household {to make the annual sacrifice}<note>Literally "to sacrifice the sacrifice of days"</note> to Yahweh and <transChange type="added">to pay</transChange> his vow.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "Once the boy <transChange type="added">is</transChange> weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear before Yahweh; and he will remain there forever."</verse>
    <verse num="23">So her husband Elkanah said to her, "{Do what seems right to you};<note>Literally "do what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good in your eyes"</note> stay until you wean him. Only may Yahweh fulfill his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then she brought him up with her when she had weaned him, <transChange type="added">along</transChange> with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin<note>Or "a <transChange type="added">clay</transChange> jar"</note> of wine. She brought him to the house of Yahweh at Shiloh while the boy <transChange type="added">was still</transChange> young.</verse>
    <verse num="25">They slaughtered the bull, and they brought the boy to Eli.</verse>
    <verse num="26">She said, "Excuse me, my lord. As {you live},<note>Literally "your soul lives"</note> my lord, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> the woman who stood with you in this <transChange type="added">place</transChange> to pray to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="27">I prayed for this boy, and Yahweh has given me my request that I asked from him.</verse>
    <verse num="28">I in turn have lent him to Yahweh. {As long as he lives}<note>Literally "All the days that he lives"</note> he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> lent to Yahweh." Then they worshiped Yahweh there. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Then Hannah prayed and said, </verse>
    <verse num="2">There is no one holy like Yahweh, for there is no one besides you, and there is no rock like our God.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Do not increase speaking {very proud}<note>Literally "proud, proud"</note> words! Let no arrogance go forth from your mouth, for Yahweh is a God of knowledge <transChange type="added">whose</transChange> deeds are not weighed.<note>So Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib); the reading tradition (Qere) reads "and by him deeds are weighed"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">The bows of mighty warriors <transChange type="added">are</transChange> shattered, but those who stumble gird <transChange type="added">themselves with</transChange> strength.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Those who were full must hire themselves out for bread, but those who are hungry will become fat. As for the infertile, she will bear seven, but <transChange type="added">she who has</transChange> many sons withers away.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Yahweh kills and restores alive, he brings down <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Sheol<note>"Sheol" is a Hebrew term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the underworld.</note> and raises up.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Yahweh makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and also exalts.</verse>
    <verse num="8">He raises up the poor from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> dust. From <transChange type="added">the</transChange> ash heap he lifts up the needy, to cause them to sit with noble people and to cause them to inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth belong to Yahweh and he has set the inhabited world on them.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He will guard the feet of his faithful<note>Or "loyal"</note> ones, but the wicked will be destroyed<note>Or "will be silenced"</note> in the darkness, because a man will not prevail by <transChange type="added">his</transChange> might.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Yahweh will shatter<note>Singular verb supported by Syriac, Targums, Septuagint, and Old Latin versions.</note> his adversaries;<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) has the singular "adversary"; the reading tradition (Qere) reads the plural</note> he will thunder against them in the heavens. Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king and will exalt the might of his anointed one.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Elkanah went to Ramah, to his house. Now the boy was serving Yahweh {in the presence of}<note>Literally "in the face of"</note> Eli the priest. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Now the sons of Eli <transChange type="added">were</transChange> {worthless scoundrels};<note>Literally "sons of Belial"</note> they did not know<note>Or "acknowledge"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the custom of the priests with the people <transChange type="added">was this</transChange>: When any man {brought a sacrifice},<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">was</transChange> sacrificing a sacrifice" and so throughout 1 &amp;amp; 2 Samuel</note> as the meat was boiling, the servant of the priest would take a three-pronged meat fork in his hand</verse>
    <verse num="14">and would thrust it into the pan or into the kettle or into the cauldron or into the cooking pot. All that the meat fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> what they used to do to all of the Israelites who came there at Shiloh.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Also, before they {offered up}<note>Literally "caused to go up in smoke"</note> the fat as a burnt offering, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest meat for roasting, for he will not take boiled meat from you, but only {raw}."<note>Literally "with the life"</note></verse>
    <verse num="16">And <transChange type="added">if</transChange> the man said to him, "Let them burn the fat completely {first},<note>Literally "as the day"</note> then take for yourself as {you}<note>Literally "as your soul"</note> desire," then he would say to him, "No!<note>According to the reading tradition (Qere)</note> Give it now! If not, I will take it by force!"</verse>
    <verse num="17">So the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of Yahweh, because the men treated the offering of Yahweh with contempt. </verse>
    <verse num="18">Now Samuel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> serving before Yahweh, as a boy wearing a linen ephod.</verse>
    <verse num="19">His mother used to make for him a small robe and take it to him {year by year}<note>Literally "from days to days"</note> whenever she came up with her husband to offer the {annual sacrifice}.<note>Literally "the sacrifice of days"</note></verse>
    <verse num="20">And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and he said, "May Yahweh give you an offspring from this woman in place of the petitioned <transChange type="added">one</transChange> that she requested from Yahweh." Then they went to their home.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Yahweh took note of Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters, while the young man Samuel grew up with Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="22">Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel and that they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> having sexual relations with the women who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> serving <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the entrance of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> tent of assembly.<note>Or "meeting"</note></verse>
    <verse num="23">And he asked them, "Why are you doing all these things that I am hearing, <transChange type="added">namely</transChange>, your evil dealings with all these people?</verse>
    <verse num="24">No, my sons, the report <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not good that I am hearing the people of Yahweh spreading.</verse>
    <verse num="25">If a man sins against a man, then God can intercede for him. But if a man sins against Yahweh, who can intercede for him?" But they did not {obey}<note>Literally "listen to the voice of"</note> their father, because Yahweh wanted to kill them.</verse>
    <verse num="26">But the boy Samuel {continued to grow in stature and in favor}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">was</transChange> going and being great and good"</note> with Yahweh and with the people. </verse>
    <verse num="27">Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him: "Thus says Yahweh: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to the house of your ancestor<note>Or "father," meaning Aaron</note> when they were in Egypt under the house of Pharaoh?</verse>
    <verse num="28">And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be a priest to me, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to bear an ephod before me. I gave to the house of your ancestor<note>Or "father"</note> all the offerings made by fire by the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note></verse>
    <verse num="29">Why do you despise my sacrifice and my offering which I commanded <transChange type="added">for my</transChange> dwelling place, while you honored your sons more than me by making yourselves fat from the best of all the offerings of my people Israel?</verse>
    <verse num="30">Therefore,' {declares}<note>Literally "the declaration of"</note> Yahweh the God of Israel, 'though I solemnly said that your house and the house of your ancestor<note>Or "father"</note> would walk before me forever, but now,' {declares}<note>Literally "the declaration of"</note> Yahweh, 'far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me, I will treat with contempt!</verse>
    <verse num="31">Look, days <transChange type="added">are</transChange> coming when I will cut off your {strength}<note>Literally "arm," figurative of "strength" in the context of "descendants"</note> and the {strength}<note>Literally "arm," figurative of "strength" in the context of "descendants"</note> of the house of your ancestor<note>Or "father"</note> {so that no one in your house will live to old age}.<note>Literally "from being old in your house"</note></verse>
    <verse num="32">You will look at the distress of my dwelling place, <transChange type="added">despite</transChange> all the good caused for Israel, but there will never be an old <transChange type="added">man</transChange> in your household {forever}!<note>Literally "all the days"</note></verse>
    <verse num="33">The only one I will not cut off from my altar <transChange type="added">is you</transChange>.<note>Understanding the beth preposition as a beth essentiae</note> <transChange type="added">Rather</transChange>, to cause your eyes to fail and to cause your soul to grieve, {all the members of your household}<note>Literally "all the abundance of your house"</note> will die <transChange type="added">as</transChange> men.<note>Or "in their prime"; some Greek and other manuscripts supply "sword" ("will die by the sword of men")</note></verse>
    <verse num="34">This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the sign for you that will come regarding your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: they will both die on the same day!</verse>
    <verse num="35">But I will raise up for myself a reliable<note>Or "faithful"</note> priest; he will do just according to what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in my heart and in my soul. I will build for him a lasting<note>Hebrew "faithful" or "reliable"</note> house and he will walk continually before my anointed one {forever}.<note>Literally "all the days"</note></verse>
    <verse num="36">All the remainder of your household will come to bow down {before}<note>Literally "to"</note> him for a bit of silver or a loaf of bread and will say, "Please assign me to one of the {priestly offices}<note>Literally "priesthoods"</note> so that I can eat a morsel of bread." '" </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Now the boy Samuel was serving Yahweh {in the presence}<note>Literally "in the face of"</note> of Eli. The word of Yahweh was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.</verse>
    <verse num="2">{And then}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> one day when Eli was lying in his place (now his eyes had begun <transChange type="added">to grow</transChange> weak so that he was not able to see)</verse>
    <verse num="3">and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, Samuel was lying in the temple<note>Although the Hebrew text reads "temple," this is a reference to the tabernacle (see 1:3, 9)</note> of Yahweh where the ark of God <transChange type="added">was</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Yahweh called out to Samuel and he said, "Here I am!"</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, because you called me." But he said, "I did not call <transChange type="added">you</transChange>. Go back and lie down." So he went and lay down.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Yahweh called Samuel again, so Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, because you called me." And he said, "I did not call you, my son. Go back <transChange type="added">and</transChange> lie down."</verse>
    <verse num="7">Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh, and the word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Again Yahweh called Samuel a third time, so he got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, because you called me." Then Eli realized that Yahweh was calling the boy.</verse>
    <verse num="9">So Eli said to Samuel "Go lie down. {If he calls}<note>Literally "And it will happen <transChange type="added">that</transChange> if he calls"</note> to you, then you must say, 'Speak Yahweh, because your servant <transChange type="added">is</transChange> listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place. </verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Yahweh came and stood <transChange type="added">there</transChange> and called out {as before},<note>Literally "as an occurrence, in an occurrence"</note> "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel said, "Speak, because your servant <transChange type="added">is</transChange> listening."</verse>
    <verse num="11">So Yahweh said to Samuel, "Look, I am doing something in Israel {which will cause}<note>Literally "about which"</note> the two ears of everyone who hears it to tingle.</verse>
    <verse num="12">On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken against his household, {from beginning to end}.<note>Literally "begin and finish"</note></verse>
    <verse num="13">I will make him know that I am about to judge his household forever because of the iniquity that he knew, for his sons <transChange type="added">were</transChange> bringing curses on themselves,<note>LXX reads "were cursing God"</note> but he did not rebuke them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Therefore I swore to the house of Eli <transChange type="added">that</transChange> the iniquity of the house of Eli would not be atoned for<note>Or "be expiated"</note> by sacrifice or by offering forever." </verse>
    <verse num="15">So Samuel lay down until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, but Samuel was afraid of telling the vision to Eli.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son!" And he said, "Here I am."</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he said, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the message<note>Or "word"</note> that he spoke to you? Please do not conceal <transChange type="added">it</transChange> from me. May God {punish you severely}<note>Literally "do to you and so may he add"</note> if you conceal anything from me of all the words that he told you."</verse>
    <verse num="18">So Samuel told him all the words and did not conceal <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> from him. And he<note>That is, Eli</note> said, "He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Yahweh, he will do {what is}<note>Literally "the"</note> good in his {sight}."<note>Literally "eyes"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="19">And Samuel grew up, and Yahweh was with him. {He did not allow any of his prophecies to go unfulfilled}.<note>Literally "He let none from all of his words fall to the ground."</note></verse>
    <verse num="20">All Israel from Dan to Beersheba realized that Samuel was faithful<note>Or "reliable" or "trustworthy"</note> as a prophet to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh, for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of Yahweh. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines for battle, and they encamped at Ebenezer, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines encamped at Aphek.</verse>
    <verse num="2"><transChange type="added">The</transChange> Philistines lined up for the battle to meet Israel, and the battle was prolonged<note>Or "drawn out"</note> until Israel was defeated before <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, {who}<note>Literally "and they"</note> killed about four thousand men {on the battlefield}.<note>Literally "in the battle line in the field"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">When the army<note>Or "people"</note> came <transChange type="added">back</transChange> to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why has Yahweh defeated us today before <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to us from Shiloh so that it may come into our midst and deliver<note>Or "save"</note> us from the hand of our enemies."</verse>
    <verse num="4">So the army sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts who sits <transChange type="added">between</transChange> the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, <transChange type="added">were</transChange> there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh arrived at the camp, all Israel {let out a loud shout}<note>Literally "shouted a great shout"</note> so that the earth shook. </verse>
    <verse num="6">When <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the noise of this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?" Then they learned that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines were afraid, for they said, "God has come<note>Or "gods have come"</note> to the camp." And they said, "Woe to us, {for this has never happened before!}<note>Literally "it has not happened like this since yesterday and since the day before that"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the <transChange type="added">same</transChange> gods who struck the Egyptians with all <transChange type="added">sorts of</transChange> plagues in the desert.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Take courage and be men, <transChange type="added">you</transChange> Philistines, lest you end up serving the Hebrews just like they have served you. Be men and fight!"</verse>
    <verse num="10">So <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines fought and Israel was defeated and each man fled to his tent, for the slaughter was very great. Thirty thousand foot soldiers from Israel fell.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Furthermore, the ark of God was captured,<note>Or "taken"</note> and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died. </verse>
    <verse num="12">A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Shiloh that same day, and his clothes <transChange type="added">were</transChange> torn and earth <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on his head.</verse>
    <verse num="13">When he came, {there was}<note>Literally "look"</note> Eli sitting on his chair {by the side of the road}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">by</transChange> the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> road"</note> watching, because his heart was anxious about the ark of God. Now the man had come {to give his report}<note>Literally "to tell"</note> in the city, and all the city cried out.</verse>
    <verse num="14">When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the noise of this commotion?" Then the man {came quickly}<note>Literally "hastened and came"</note> and told Eli.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now Eli <transChange type="added">was</transChange> {ninety-eight years old}<note>Literally "a son of ninety and eight years"</note> and his eyes {stayed fixed ahead}<note>Literally "were standing"</note> and he was not able to see.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the man said to Eli, "I am the <transChange type="added">one</transChange> who has come from the battle line! I have fled today from the battle line!" And he said, "{What exactly happened},<note>Literally "what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the thing/matter"</note> my son?"</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then the messenger answered and said, "Israel has fled before <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines. There has been a great defeat among the troops. Also, your two sons have died, Hophni and Phinehas, and the ark of God has been captured."</verse>
    <verse num="18">Just as he mentioned the ark of God, he<note>That is, Eli</note> fell from his chair backwards against the side of the gate. He broke his neck and died, because the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, <transChange type="added">was</transChange> pregnant and <transChange type="added">about</transChange> to give birth. When she heard the news concerning the capture of the ark of God and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she {went into labor}<note>Literally "bowed down"</note> and gave birth, because her labor pains came upon her.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Just before the time of her death, those {attending her}<note>Literally "standing over her"</note> said, "Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son." But she did not answer, or {pay any attention}.<note>Literally "set her heart"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">She called the boy Ichabod,<note>The name "Ichabod" means "no glory"</note> saying, "The glory has departed from Israel," referring to the capture of the ark of God and concerning her father-in-law and husband.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And she said, "The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God was captured."<note>Or "taken"</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Now <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines had captured<note>Or "taken"</note> the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.</verse>
    <verse num="3">When the Ashdodites got up early the next morning, {there was}<note>Literally "look"</note> Dagon fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh! So they took Dagon and returned him to his place.</verse>
    <verse num="4">When they got up early in the morning the next day, {there was}<note>Literally "look"</note> Dagon fallen <transChange type="added">again</transChange> with his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh! The head of Dagon and the palms of his two hands were cut off, lying at<note>Hebrew "to"</note> the threshold; only <transChange type="added">the body</transChange><note>The phrase may suggest that only the "fish" part of Dagon was left</note> of Dagon was left.</verse>
    <verse num="5">(Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who come into the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod until this <transChange type="added">very</transChange> day.) </verse>
    <verse num="6">Now the hand of Yahweh was heavy against the Ashdodites and he destroyed them and struck them with tumors,<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "boils"; the reading tradition (Qere) has "tumors"</note> both in Ashdod and its territories.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The men of Ashdod saw <transChange type="added">that</transChange> it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> so, and they said, "The ark of the God of Israel should not remain with us, because his hand <transChange type="added">is</transChange> harsh on us and on Dagon our god!"</verse>
    <verse num="8">So they sent and gathered all the rulers of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines to them, and they asked, "What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" And they said, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around toward Gath." So they moved the ark of the God of Israel <transChange type="added">to Gath</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="9">After they moved it, the hand of Yahweh was against the city, causing a very great confusion, and he struck the men of the city {from the youngest to the oldest},<note>Literally "from small up to great"</note> causing tumors<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "boils"; the reading tradition (Qere) has "tumors"</note> to break out on them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So they sent the ark of God <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Ekron. But when the ark of God came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, "They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our<note>Hebrew "me and my"</note> people!"</verse>
    <verse num="11">So they sent and gathered all the rulers of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, and they said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it return to its place, so that it will not kill us and our people." For a {deadly confusion}<note>Literally "a confusion of death"; indicates a genitive of attribute</note> was throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.</verse>
    <verse num="12">The men who did not die were struck with <transChange type="added">the</transChange> tumors,<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "boils"; the reading tradition (Qere) has "tumors"</note> so that the cry of the city for help went up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> heaven. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Now the ark of Yahweh had been in the territory of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">for</transChange> seven months,</verse>
    <verse num="2">and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines called to the priests and to those who practiced divination, saying, "What should we do with the ark of Yahweh? Inform us how we should send it to its place."</verse>
    <verse num="3">They said, "If you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> sending the ark of the God of Israel away, you must not send it away empty, but by all means return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will become known to you why his hand <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not turned aside from you."</verse>
    <verse num="4">And they said, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the guilt offering that we should return to him?" They said, "The number of the rulers of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">is</transChange> five. Therefore send five gold tumors<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "boils"; the reading tradition (Qere) has "tumors"</note> and five gold mice, because one plague <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on all of you and all your rulers.</verse>
    <verse num="5">You must make images of your tumors<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "boils"; the reading tradition (Qere) has "tumors"</note> and images of your mice that <transChange type="added">are</transChange> ravaging the land, and you must give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand on you and on your gods and on your land.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Why should you harden your hearts like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? Is it not just like when he dealt with them wantonly so that they sent them away and they left?</verse>
    <verse num="7">So then, {prepare}<note>Literally "take and make"</note> one new utility cart and two milking cows that have never had a yoke on them, and you must harness the cows to the utility cart and then turn their calves from following them to their stall.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And you must take the ark of Yahweh and place it on the utility cart with the gold objects that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> returning to him as a guilt offering. You must place <transChange type="added">them</transChange> in the container<note>Or perhaps "chest" or "bag"</note> beside <transChange type="added">the ark</transChange> and then send it <transChange type="added">off</transChange> so that it goes away.</verse>
    <verse num="9">You must watch; if it goes up by the way of its territory to Beth Shemesh, he has caused this great disaster to <transChange type="added">come on</transChange> us. But if not, then we will know his hand has not struck us; it <transChange type="added">was by</transChange> chance <transChange type="added">that</transChange> this happened to us.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So the men did so; they took two milking cows and harnessed them to the utility cart, but they shut up their calves in the stall.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then they put the ark of Yahweh on the utility cart with the container<note>Or perhaps "chest" or "bag"</note> <transChange type="added">holding</transChange> the gold mice and the images of their tumors.</verse>
    <verse num="12">The cows went straight on the way on the road to Beth Shemesh, on the one main road, {lowing as they went}.<note>Literally "they went going and lowing"</note> They did not turn aside to the right or to the left, and the rulers of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">were</transChange> walking after them up to the border of Beth Shemesh. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Now <transChange type="added">the people of</transChange> Beth Shemesh <transChange type="added">were</transChange> reaping the wheat harvest in the valley. They lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and they were glad to see <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="14">The utility cart came to the field of Joshua <transChange type="added">of</transChange> Beth Shemesh and stopped there where there <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a large stone. They split the wood of the utility cart and sacrificed the cows <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a burnt offering to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then the Levites took down the ark of Yahweh and the container<note>Or perhaps "chest" or "bag"</note> that was beside it, in which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> the gold objects, and <transChange type="added">they</transChange> set them on the large stone.<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text reads "Abel" here; some Hebrew manuscripts and LXX read "stone" (see 6:14-15)</note> Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings, and they {made}<note>Literally "sacrificed"</note> sacrifices to Yahweh on that day.</verse>
    <verse num="16">The five rulers of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines saw <transChange type="added">it</transChange> and returned <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Ekron that <transChange type="added">same</transChange> day. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Now these <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the gold tumors which <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines returned <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a guilt offering to Yahweh: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the gold mice <transChange type="added">according to</transChange> the number of all the cities of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, for their five rulers, from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> fortified city to the unwalled village of the open country as far as the great stone, {where they set}<note>Literally "which they set down on it"</note> the ark of Yahweh until this day in the field of Joshua <transChange type="added">of</transChange> Beth Shemesh.</verse>
    <verse num="19">He<note>That is, Yahweh</note> struck seventy men<note>Though the MT has "seventy men, fifty thousand men" (= 50,070), it is likely the original was "seventy men"</note> among the men of Beth Shemesh because they looked into the ark of Yahweh. So the people mourned because Yahweh had struck a great blow among the people.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then the men of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? And to whom shall it<note>That is, the ark of the covenant (alternatively read as "he," referring to Yahweh)</note> go up from us?"</verse>
    <verse num="21">So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim saying, "<transChange type="added">The</transChange> Philistines have returned the ark of Yahweh. Come down and take it up to yourselves." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">The men of Kiriath Jearim came and brought up the ark of Yahweh, and they brought it to the house of Abinadab in Gibeah. They consecrated Eleazer his son to guard the ark of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="2">{From}<note>Literally "And it happened from"</note> the day the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, {days multiplied and became twenty years}<note>Literally "and the days were numerous, and they were twenty years"</note> while all the house of Israel mourned after Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, "If with all your heart you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> turning to Yahweh, remove the foreign gods and Ashtoreths<note>Hebrew plural "Ashtaroth" (Ashtoreth was the female consort of Ba'al)</note> from your midst. Commit your hearts to Yahweh and serve him alone. Then he will deliver you from the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines."</verse>
    <verse num="4">So the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> removed the Baals<note>Hebrew plural "Be'alim" (Ba'al was a major Canaanite deity)</note> and the Ashtoreths, and they served Yahweh alone. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Yahweh for you."</verse>
    <verse num="6">So they gathered to Mizpah and drew water and poured <transChange type="added">it</transChange> out before Yahweh. They fasted on that day and said there, "We have sinned against Yahweh!" So Samuel judged the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> at Mizpah.</verse>
    <verse num="7"><transChange type="added">Now</transChange> when <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines heard that the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> had gathered at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> heard <transChange type="added">of it</transChange>, {they were afraid of the Philistines}.<note>Literally "and they were afraid from (= because of) the presence of the Philistines"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Then the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> said to Samuel, "{You must not cease}<note>Literally "You must not be silent from us"</note> from crying out to Yahweh our God, so that he will deliver us from the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines."</verse>
    <verse num="9">So Samuel took a single {nursing lamb}<note>Literally "lamb of milk"</note> and sacrificed <transChange type="added">it</transChange> as a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. Then Samuel cried out to Yahweh on behalf of Israel, and Yahweh answered him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">{While}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> Samuel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sacrificing the burnt offering, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines drew near for the battle against Israel. But Yahweh thundered against <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines with a great noise on that day and threw them into confusion so that they were defeated before Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines and they struck them down as far as below Beth Car. </verse>
    <verse num="12">So Samuel took a single stone and put <transChange type="added">it</transChange> between Mizpah and Shen, and he named it Ebenezer and said, "Up to here Yahweh has helped us."</verse>
    <verse num="13">So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come into the territory of Israel again, and the hand of Yahweh was against <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines all the days of Samuel.</verse>
    <verse num="14">The towns<note>Or "cities"</note> which <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines had taken from Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> returned to Israel from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territories from the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines. Then there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. </verse>
    <verse num="15">Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</verse>
    <verse num="16">He used to go <transChange type="added">on the circuit</transChange> {from year to year}.<note>Literally "from what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> required year in year"</note> He went around Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel <transChange type="added">in</transChange> all these places.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then {he returned}<note>Literally "and his return <transChange type="added">was</transChange>"</note> to Ramah, because his house was there, and there he judged Israel, and he built an altar to Yahweh there. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The name of his firstborn son <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Joel, and the name of his second son <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Abijah. <transChange type="added">They were</transChange> judges in Beersheba.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after gain, they took bribes, and they perverted justice. </verse>
    <verse num="4">So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.</verse>
    <verse num="5">They said to him, "Look, you are old and your sons do not follow in your ways. So then appoint a king for us to judge<note>Or "to rule"</note> us, like all the nations.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But the matter {was displeasing to Samuel}<note>Literally "was evil in the eyes of Samuel"</note> when they said, "Give us a king to judge<note>Or "to rule"</note> us," so Samuel prayed to Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Yahweh said to Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people concerning all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Like all the deeds they have done from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day, they have forsaken me and have served other gods--so they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> doing to you also.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And so then, listen to their voice. However, you must earnestly warn them; you must explain to them the custom of the king who will rule over them." </verse>
    <verse num="10">So Samuel spoke all the words of Yahweh to the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> requesting a king from him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">He said, "This will be the custom of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots.</verse>
    <verse num="12">He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and <transChange type="added">those</transChange> {to do his plowing}<note>Literally "to plow his plowing"</note> and to reap his harvest, and <transChange type="added">those</transChange> to make weapons of war and the equipment for his chariots.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He will take your daughters as <transChange type="added">his</transChange> perfume makers and as cooks and as bakers.</verse>
    <verse num="14">He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive trees and will give <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to his servants.</verse>
    <verse num="15">He will take a tenth of your seed and your vineyards and give <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to his high officials and to his servants.</verse>
    <verse num="16">He will take your male slaves and your female slaves and the best of your young men<note>LXX reads "cattle"</note> and your donkeys and {will use them for his projects}.<note>Literally "will put <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to his work"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">He will take a tenth of your flocks,<note>The Hebrew term refers collectively to both sheep and goats (small livestock animals)</note> and you <transChange type="added">yourselves</transChange> will become his servants.</verse>
    <verse num="18">So you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but Yahweh will not answer you on that day!"</verse>
    <verse num="19">However, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel and they said, "No, but there must be a king over us,</verse>
    <verse num="20">so that we {also}<note>Literally "even we"</note> may be like all the nations, and our king may rule us and go out before us and fight our battles." </verse>
    <verse num="21">Now when Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then Yahweh said to Samuel, "Listen to their voice, and appoint a king for them." So Samuel spoke to the men of Israel, "Each of you go to his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> town." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">Now there was a man from Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjaminite, {a very wealthy man}.<note>Literally "a man mighty of wealth" or "a man mighty of valor"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">He had a son whose name was Saul,<note>The name "Saul" means "the requested one"</note> a young and handsome man. There was not a man from the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> more handsome than he <transChange type="added">was</transChange>; from his shoulders up, he was taller than all the people. </verse>
    <verse num="3">Now the female donkeys of Kish the father of Saul got lost, and Kish said to Saul his son, "Please take one of the servants with you and get up; go and seek the female donkeys."</verse>
    <verse num="4">So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim; he passed through the land of Shalisha but they did not find <transChange type="added">them</transChange>. They passed through the land of Shaalim but they were not there. He passed through the land of Benjamin but did not find <transChange type="added">them</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="5">When they entered the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him, "Come, let us return, lest my father cease <transChange type="added">caring about</transChange> the female donkeys and worry about us!"</verse>
    <verse num="6">But he<note>That is, Saul's servant</note> said to him, "Look, a man of God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in this town, and the man <transChange type="added">is</transChange> honored. All that he says certainly comes true. So then let us go there; perhaps he will tell us about our journey on which we have gone."</verse>
    <verse num="7">So Saul said to his servant, "Look, we may go, but what should we bring to the man? For the bread <transChange type="added">is</transChange> gone from our bags, and there <transChange type="added">is</transChange> no present to bring to the man of God. What <transChange type="added">do we have</transChange> with us?"</verse>
    <verse num="8">The servant again answered Saul and said, "Look, {I have}<note>Literally "what was found"</note> in my hand a quarter shekel of silver! I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us our way."</verse>
    <verse num="9">(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say: "Come, let us go up to the seer." For the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.)</verse>
    <verse num="10">So Saul said to his servant, "{Your suggestion is a good one}.<note>Literally "Your word <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good"</note> Come, let us go." And they went to the town where the man of God <transChange type="added">was</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="11">They <transChange type="added">were</transChange> going up the ascent of the town when they found young women going out to draw water. They said to them, "Is there the seer here?"</verse>
    <verse num="12">They answered them and said, "There is. Look, <transChange type="added">he is</transChange> just in front of you! Hurry now, because he has come to the town today, because there <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a sacrifice for the people today at the high place.</verse>
    <verse num="13">As soon as you enter the town, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice. Then afterward the invited <transChange type="added">guests</transChange> will eat. So then, go up, because you will find him today!"</verse>
    <verse num="14">So they went up to the town. As they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> entering into the middle of the town, Samuel was coming forth to meet them, to go up to the high place. </verse>
    <verse num="15">Now Yahweh {had revealed this to}<note>Literally "had opened the ear"</note> Samuel the day before Saul arrived, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="16">"This time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you must anoint him as leader over my people Israel. He will deliver my people from the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines. For I have seen <transChange type="added">the suffering of</transChange> my people, because their cry <transChange type="added">of distress</transChange> has come to me."</verse>
    <verse num="17">When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh answered him, "Here <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the man about whom I told you! This <transChange type="added">is the</transChange> one <transChange type="added">who</transChange> will govern my people." </verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and said, "Please tell me, where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the house of the seer?"</verse>
    <verse num="19">Samuel answered Saul and said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> the seer. Go up {ahead of me}<note>Literally "before my face"</note> to the high place, and you will eat with me today; then I will send you away in the morning. I will tell you all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> {on your mind}.<note>Literally "in your heart"</note></verse>
    <verse num="20">And as for your female donkeys that were lost {three days ago},<note>Literally "the day three of the days"</note> {do not be concerned about them},<note>Literally "you shall not put your heart to them"</note> because they have been found. For whom <transChange type="added">is</transChange> all the desire of Israel? Is it not for you and for all the house of your father?" </verse>
    <verse num="21">Saul answered and said, "<transChange type="added">Am</transChange> I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the humblest of all the families of the tribes of Benjamin? Why do you speak to me {in this way}?"<note>Literally "according to this word"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">So Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them to a room in the building and gave them a place at the head of {the invited guests}.<note>Literally "the ones being invited"</note> There were about thirty men.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion that I gave to you, about which I said to you, 'Keep it with you.'"</verse>
    <verse num="24">So the cook took up the shank and what was on it and put it before Saul, and he<note>That is, Samuel</note> said, "Look, {the saved portion}<note>Literally "what was being kept"</note> <transChange type="added">is</transChange> placed {before you}<note>Literally "to your face"</note>--eat, because it has been kept for you for the appointed time," {and he said},<note>Literally "saying"</note> "I have invited the people." So Saul ate with Samuel that day. </verse>
    <verse num="25">When they came down from the high place to the town, he spoke with Saul on the roof.</verse>
    <verse num="26">They got up early, {and as dawn was breaking},<note>Literally "as the dawn was going up"</note> Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, "Get up, so that I can send you away." So Saul got up and the two of them, he and Samuel, went outside.</verse>
    <verse num="27">As they were going down to the outskirts of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to pass on before us. When he has passed, you stand here {a while},<note>Literally "as the day"</note> so that I can make known to you <transChange type="added">the</transChange> word of God." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it over his head and kissed him and said, "{Has not}<note>Literally "Is it not that"</note> Yahweh anointed you as leader over his inheritance?</verse>
    <verse num="2">As you go from with me {today},<note>Literally "the day"</note> you will find two men near the burial site of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, 'The female donkeys that you went to search for have been found.' Now look, your father {is no longer concerned about}<note>Literally "has given up the matter of"</note> the female donkeys and has begun worrying about you,<note>Here the pronoun is plural, referring to Saul and his servant</note> saying, 'What should I do about my son?'</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then you will go on from there and further you will come to the oak of Tabor. There three men will meet you, who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> going up to God at Bethel. One will be carrying three male kid goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a skin of wine.</verse>
    <verse num="4">{They will ask how you are doing}<note>Literally "they will ask peace for you"</note> and will give you two loaves, which you will take from their hand.</verse>
    <verse num="5">After this, you will come to the Gibeah of God,<note>Or "to Gibeath Elohim," which means "the hill of God"</note> where there are sentries<note>Or "garrisons" or "overseers"</note> of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines. {Just as you enter}<note>Literally "and will it happen that as you enter"</note> the town there, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place, with harp, tambourine, flute, and zither before them, and they will be prophesying.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the Spirit of Yahweh will rush upon you,<note>Or "will come upon you in power"</note> and you will prophesy with them; and you will turn into {a different person}.<note>Literally "another man"</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">When these signs come to you, do for yourself what your hand finds <transChange type="added">to do</transChange>, for God <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> with you.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then you will go down before me to Gilgal. Look, I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings {and to make}<note>Literally "to sacrifice sacrifices of"</note> fellowship offerings. You must wait seven days until I come to you. Then I will let you know what you should do."</verse>
    <verse num="9">{Just as he turned}<note>Literally "And it happened as he turned"</note> his shoulder to depart from Samuel, God {changed his}<note>Literally "gave for him another"</note> heart. And all these signs were fulfilled on that day. </verse>
    <verse num="10">When they went from there to Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him,<note>Or "came upon him in power"</note> and he prophesied among them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">{And when}<note>Literally "and it happened"</note> all who knew him {formerly}<note>Literally "three days from yesterday"</note> saw that he prophesied with prophets, the people said to one another, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this <transChange type="added">that</transChange> has happened to the son of Kish? <transChange type="added">Is</transChange> Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>
    <verse num="12">And a man from there responded and said, "And who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> their father?" Therefore it became a proverb: "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>
    <verse num="13">When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, "Where did you go?" And he said, "To search <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the female donkeys; and when we saw none, we went to Samuel."</verse>
    <verse num="15">So Saul's uncle said to him, "Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?"</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Saul said to his uncle, "He told us for certain that the female donkeys had been found." But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingship <transChange type="added">of</transChange> which Samuel had spoken. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Samuel summoned the people to Yahweh at Mizpah,</verse>
    <verse num="18">and he said to the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> "Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: 'I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> oppressing you.'</verse>
    <verse num="19">But you today have rejected your God who always delivers you from all of your calamities and your distresses. You have said to him, 'No, but you must appoint a king over us!' So then present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and by your clans." </verse>
    <verse num="20">So Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected by lot.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then he brought near the tribe of Benjamin according to its families, and the family of Matri was selected by lot. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen, and they sought him, but he could not be found.</verse>
    <verse num="22">So they inquired again of Yahweh, "{Did the man come here}?" <note>Literally "Did he come still here a man"</note> And Yahweh said, "Look, he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> hiding himself among the baggage."</verse>
    <verse num="23">So they ran and took him from there, and when he took his stand among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders and up.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see him whom Yahweh has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people!" And all the people shouted and said, "Long live the king!" </verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Samuel told the people the custom of the kingship, and he wrote <transChange type="added">the rules</transChange> down on a scroll and laid <transChange type="added">it</transChange> before Yahweh. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own house.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Saul also went to his house at Gibeah, and the troops whose hearts<note>Hebrew "heart"</note> God had touched went with him.</verse>
    <verse num="27">However, some {worthless men}<note>Literally "sons of wickedness"</note> said, "How can this <transChange type="added">man</transChange> deliver us?" So they despised him and brought no gift to him, but he kept silent.<note>The Dead Sea Scrolls contained a nearly complete scroll of 1 and 2 Samuel, the oldest Hebrew manuscript extant. There is a story therein that provides a setting for the acts of Nahash in 1 Samuel 11, which otherwise seems to occur obtrusively. This story may be translated: "Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, harshly tormented the Gadites and the Reubenites, and he gouged out all their right eyes, and struck terror <transChange type="added">and dread</transChange> in Israel. No Israelite beyond the Jordan remained whose right eye was not gouged out by Nahash king of the Ammonites, except for seven thousand men who had fled from the Ammonites and entered Jabesh Gilead. About a month later ..." This early text leaves off with 11:1 at this point</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">Now Nahash the Ammonite went up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "{Make a treaty with us}<note>Literally "Cut with us a covenant"</note> and we will serve you."</verse>
    <verse num="2">But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "On this <transChange type="added">condition</transChange> {I will make a treaty}<note>Literally "I will cut"</note> with you, by gouging out the right eye of each of you, so that I can make it a disgrace for all Israel."</verse>
    <verse num="3">So the elders of Jabesh said to him, "Leave us alone for seven days so that we may send messengers in all the territory of Israel, and if there <transChange type="added">is</transChange> no deliverer for us, then we will come out to you."</verse>
    <verse num="4">When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, {they reported these things to}<note>Literally "they spoke the words in the ears of"</note> the people. Then all the people lifted up their voices and wept.</verse>
    <verse num="5">{Just then},<note>Literally "And look/behold"</note> Saul was coming from the field behind the cattle. Saul said, "What <transChange type="added">is the matter</transChange> with the people, that they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> weeping?" So they recounted to him the words of the men of Jabesh. </verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and {he became very angry}.<note>Literally "his nose became very hot"</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them into pieces and sent <transChange type="added">them</transChange> throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, "Whoever <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not going out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen." Then the fear of Yahweh fell on the people and they went out as one man.</verse>
    <verse num="8">He mustered them at Bezek; the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> <transChange type="added">were</transChange> three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah <transChange type="added">were</transChange> thirty thousand.</verse>
    <verse num="9">They said to the messengers who had come, "Thus you will say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: 'Tomorrow deliverance for you will come {when the sun is hot}.'"<note>Literally "at the heating of the sun"</note> When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced.</verse>
    <verse num="10">The men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us {whatever seems good to you}."<note>Literally "as all <transChange type="added">of</transChange> the good <transChange type="added">that is</transChange> in your eyes"</note></verse>
    <verse num="11">{And the}<note>Literally "and it happened the"</note> next day Saul placed the people <transChange type="added">in</transChange> three divisions. Then they came into the middle of the camp {at the early morning watch}<note>Literally "at the night watch of the morning"</note> and struck down {the Ammonites}<note>Literally "Ammon"</note> until the heat of the day. It happened that the remainder were scattered {so that no two among them remained together}.<note>Literally "and they did not remain among them two together"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the people said to Samuel, "Who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the one who asked, 'Will Saul reign over us?' Give the men to us that we may kill them."</verse>
    <verse num="13">But Saul said, "No one will be put to death on this day, because {today}<note>Literally "the day"</note> Yahweh has provided deliverance in Israel." </verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal, and let us renew the kingship there."</verse>
    <verse num="15">So all the people went to Gilgal and they made Saul king there before Yahweh in Gilgal. They sacrificed fellowship offerings there before Yahweh. Then Saul rejoiced there greatly <transChange type="added">along with</transChange> all the men of Israel. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">Then Samuel said to all Israel, "Look, I have listened to your voice regarding all that you have said to me, so I have set a king over you.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And so then here <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the king walking about before you. Now I am old and gray, but my sons (look at them!) <transChange type="added">are</transChange> with you; and I have walked about before you from my youth until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Here I am! Testify against me before Yahweh and before his anointed one! Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I exploited? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, that I may shut my eyes {regarding}<note>Literally "with"</note> him?-then I will restore it to you."</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then they said, "You have not exploited us or oppressed us, and you have not taken anything from the hand of anyone."</verse>
    <verse num="5">So he said to them, "Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> witness against you, and his anointed one <transChange type="added">is</transChange> witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand." Then they said, "<transChange type="added">He is</transChange> witness."</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Samuel said to the people, "Yahweh <transChange type="added">is witness</transChange>, who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> up from the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So then take your stand, so that I may judge you before Yahweh with <transChange type="added">regard to</transChange> all the <transChange type="added">deeds of</transChange> justice<note>Or "righteous <transChange type="added">deeds</transChange>"</note> of Yahweh that he performed with both you and your ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="8">"When Jacob came to Egypt, your ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> cried out to Yahweh, so he sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought your ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> out from Egypt and settled them in this place.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But they forgot Yahweh their God, so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the hosts of Hazor, and into the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So they cried out to Yahweh and said, 'We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh and have served the Baals<note>Hebrew plural "Be'alim" (Ba'al was a major Canaanite deity)</note> and the Ashtoreths.<note>Hebrew plural "Ashtoroth" (Ashtoreth was the female consort of Ba'al)</note> But now deliver us from the hand of our enemies and we will serve you!'</verse>
    <verse num="11">So Yahweh sent Jerub-Baal and Bedan<note>Many English translations follow the LXX here and read "Barak"</note> and Jephthah and Samuel. Then he delivered you from the hand of your enemies all around, and you lived <transChange type="added">in</transChange> security. </verse>
    <verse num="12">"And when you saw that Nahash, the king of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> {Ammonites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> was coming against you, you said to me, 'No! A king shall reign over us,' although Yahweh your God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your king.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So then look! <transChange type="added">Here is</transChange> the king you have chosen, for whom you have asked! Look, Yahweh has placed a king over you!</verse>
    <verse num="14">If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not be rebellious against {what Yahweh says},<note>Literally "the mouth of Yahweh"</note> and both you and the king who rules over you will <transChange type="added">follow</transChange> after Yahweh your God, <transChange type="added">all will be well</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But, if you do not listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you rebel against {what Yahweh says},<note>Literally "the mouth of Yahweh"</note> then the hand of Yahweh will be against you<note>Here LXX reads "against you and against your king"</note> <transChange type="added">as it was</transChange> against your ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="16">So then take your stand again and see this great thing that Yahweh <transChange type="added">is going to</transChange> do before your eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="17"><transChange type="added">Is</transChange> the wheat harvest not today? I will call out to Yahweh so that he still sends thunder and rain, so that you will know and will see that your wickedness <transChange type="added">is</transChange> great that you have done in the eyes of Yahweh by asking for a king for yourselves." </verse>
    <verse num="18">So Samuel called out to Yahweh, and Yahweh brought thunder and rain that <transChange type="added">same</transChange> day, so all the people feared Yahweh and Samuel greatly.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then all the people said to Samuel, "Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God so that we will not die, because we have added to all our sins by requesting a king for ourselves."</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Samuel said to the people, "Do not fear! You have done all this evil; only do not turn aside from {following}<note>Literally "after"</note> Yahweh. But you must serve Yahweh with all your heart.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And do not turn aside after the triviality,<note>That is, the triviality of lifeless idols. The same Hebrew word, tohu, is used in Genesis 1:2 to describe the pre-created state of the earth.</note> which have no value and cannot deliver, for they are triviality.</verse>
    <verse num="22">For Yahweh will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name, because Yahweh has decided to make you his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> people.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Also, as for me, far be it from me {that I should sin}<note>Literally "from sinning"</note> against Yahweh by ceasing to pray for you! I will instruct you in the good and righteous way.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Only fear Yahweh and serve him faithfully with all of your heart. For consider {what great things he has done for you}.<note>Literally "what he made great with you"</note></verse>
    <verse num="25">But if you continue to do wickedness, both you and your king will be swept away." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">Saul <transChange type="added">was thirty</transChange><note>A few LXX manuscripts have "thirty," but the number of years is missing from the Masoretic Hebrew text</note> {years old}<note>Literally "a son of years"</note> at the beginning of his reign, and he reigned <transChange type="added">forty-</transChange>two years<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text reads "two years" here, but this number seems far too small; either it is not correct or part of the number is missing (the present translation supplies "forty"); other English versions differ as to Saul's age at coronation and the total years of his reign</note> over Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He chose for himself three thousand from Israel. Two thousand <transChange type="added">of these</transChange> were with Saul at Micmash in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. He sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Jonathan defeated the garrison of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> at Geba, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines heard <transChange type="added">about it</transChange>. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear!"</verse>
    <verse num="4">And all Israel did hear, saying, "Saul has defeated the garrison of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines; and also, Israel has become a stench among <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines!" So the people were called out after Saul at Gilgal. </verse>
    <verse num="5">And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and an army as numerous as sand which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on the seashore. And they came up and encamped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven. </verse>
    <verse num="6">When the men of Israel saw that <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> {too difficult}<note>Literally "too narrow"</note> for them, because the army was hard pressed, the people hid themselves in the caves, in the thorn bushes, in the cliffs, in the vaults<note>Or "cellars" or "tombs" ' or "strongholds"</note> and in the wells.</verse>
    <verse num="7"><transChange type="added">Some</transChange> of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the army {followed him trembling}.<note>Literally "trembled after him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">He waited seven days according to the appointed time Samuel determined, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and {the army started to slip away from him}.<note>Literally "the people scattered away from him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">So Saul said, "Bring here to me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings." Then he offered up the burnt offering.</verse>
    <verse num="10">{Just as}<note>Literally "And it happened as"</note> he finished offering the burnt sacrifice, Samuel was coming. So Saul went out to meet him <transChange type="added">and</transChange> to bless him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But Samuel said, "What have you done?" Saul said, "Because I saw that the army {was scattering}<note>Literally "dispersed themselves"</note> from me and you did not come {at the appointed time}<note>Literally "according to the appointed time of the days"</note> and <transChange type="added">that the</transChange> Philistines had gathered at Micmash,</verse>
    <verse num="12">therefore I said, 'Now <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not yet implored the face of Yahweh.' So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering." </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Samuel said to Saul, "You have behaved foolishly! You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God which he commanded you. For then, Yahweh would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But now, your kingdom will not endure. Yahweh has sought for himself a man according to his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> heart, and Yahweh has appointed him as leader over his people, because you have not kept what Yahweh commanded you." </verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Samuel got up and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Saul and Jonathan his son and the army that remained with them <transChange type="added">were</transChange> staying in Geba <transChange type="added">of</transChange> Benjamin, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines encamped at Micmash.</verse>
    <verse num="17">The {raiders}<note>Literally "destroyers"</note> went out from the camp of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">in</transChange> three divisions. One division turned on the road<note>Or "way"</note> to Ophrah toward the land of Shual.</verse>
    <verse num="18">One division turned on the road<note>Or "way"</note> to Beth Horon, and one turned on the road<note>Or "way"</note> toward the border overlooking the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Now no skilled craftsman could be found in all the land of Israel, for <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines had said, "So that the Hebrews cannot make swords or spears for themselves."</verse>
    <verse num="20">So all Israel <transChange type="added">went</transChange> down to <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, each to have his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his iron plowshare<note>So the Masoretic Hebrew text; LXX reads "sickle"</note> sharpened.</verse>
    <verse num="21">The charge<note>Or "fee"</note> was {two-thirds of a shekel}<note>Literally "a pim" (possibly a stone weight used as a measure)</note> for the plowshare and for the mattock, and {a third of a shekel for the pick}<note>Literally "and for three, a pick" (uncertain; perhaps meaning "a third of a shekel," or a three-pronged pick"</note> and for the axe, and to set the goading sticks.</verse>
    <verse num="22">{So}<note>Literally, "And it happened"</note> on <transChange type="added">the</transChange> day of battle, there was not a sword or a spear found in the hands of all the army that was with Saul and Jonathan, but {Saul and his son Jonathan had them}.<note>Literally, "it could be found for Saul and for Jonathan his son"</note></verse>
    <verse num="23">Now the garrison of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines went out to the pass of Micmash. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="14">
    <verse num="1">{One day}<note>Literally "And it happened the day"</note> Jonathan the son of Saul said to {his armor bearer},<note>Literally "the young man carrying his weapons"</note> "Come and let us go over to the garrison of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> over there." But he did not tell his father.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now Saul <transChange type="added">was</transChange> staying at the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Migron, and the troops that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him <transChange type="added">were</transChange> about six hundred men.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Now Ahijah, the son of Ahitub (the brother of Ichabod), the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of Yahweh at Shiloh, was carrying an ephod. The troops did not know that Jonathan had gone.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Now between the passes where Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> a crag of rock {on one side}<note>Literally "from the beyond from this"</note> and a crag of rock {on the other}.<note>Literally "from the beyond from this"</note> The name of the one <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Bozez and the name of the other <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Seneh.</verse>
    <verse num="5">The one crag on the north <transChange type="added">was</transChange> opposite Micmash and the other on the south <transChange type="added">was</transChange> opposite Geba.</verse>
    <verse num="6">So Jonathan said to {his armor bearer},<note>Literally "the young man carrying his weapons"</note> "Come, let us go over to the garrisons of these uncircumcised; perhaps Yahweh will act for us, for there is no hindrance for Yahweh to save by many or by few."</verse>
    <verse num="7">And {his armor bearer}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the one</transChange> carrying his weapons"</note> said, "Do all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in your heart {that you are inclined to do}.<note>Literally "turn/incline for yourself"</note> {I am with you all of the way}!<note>Literally "Behold, I am with you according to your heart"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Then Jonathan said, "Look, we <transChange type="added">are about to</transChange> go over to the men; and we will show ourselves to them.</verse>
    <verse num="9">If they say to us: 'Wait until we reach you,' {then we will stand as we are}<note>Literally "and we will stand under us"</note> and not go up to them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will go up, for Yahweh has given them into our hand, and this <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> the sign for us."</verse>
    <verse num="11">So the two of them showed themselves to the garrison of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines said, "The Hebrews <transChange type="added">are</transChange> coming out from the holes in which they have hidden themselves."</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and {his armor bearer},<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the one</transChange> carrying his weapons"</note> "Come up to us and we will show you something!" Then Jonathan said to {his armor bearer},<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the one</transChange> carrying his weapons"</note> "Come up after me, for Yahweh has given them into the hand of Israel!"</verse>
    <verse num="13">So Jonathan went up on his hands and his feet, with {his armor bearer}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the one</transChange> carrying his weapons"</note> after him. They fell before Jonathan and then {his armor bearer}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the one</transChange> carrying his weapons"</note> would kill them after him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">So was the first attack <transChange type="added">in</transChange> which Jonathan and {his armor bearer}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the one</transChange> carrying his weapons"</note> killed about twenty men within about half of a furrow in an acre of <transChange type="added">an</transChange> open field.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then there was terror<note>Or "panic"</note> in the camp, in the open field, and among all the army of the garrison. Even the {raiders}<note>Literally "destroyers"</note> trembled. The earth shook, and it became {a very great panic}.<note>Literally "like the panic/terror of God"; some interpreters understand this to be a panic caused by God, while others understand the expression merely as a superlative ("a very great panic")</note> </verse>
    <verse num="16">And the lookouts of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin saw {that}<note>Literally "and look"</note> the multitude {surged back and forth}.<note>Literally "waved, going here and there"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">Saul said to the troops that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, "Please call the roll and see who has gone from us." So they called the roll {and found that}<note>Literally "and look"</note> Jonathan and {his armor bearer}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the one</transChange> carrying his weapons"</note> were not <transChange type="added">present</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring near the ark of God"<note>LXX reads "bring near the ephod"</note> (for the ark of God was {at that time}<note>Literally "on that day"</note> with the {Israelites}).<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">While<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Saul was still speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines {increased more and more},<note>Literally "and it went, going and increasing"</note> so Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand!"</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Saul and all the troops who were with him were assembled on command and came up to the battle, and look! Each <transChange type="added">Philistine's</transChange> sword <transChange type="added">was</transChange> against his friend; <transChange type="added">and there was</transChange> a very great confusion.</verse>
    <verse num="21">The Hebrews who had been for <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines {previously},<note>Literally "as yesterday three days ago"</note> who had gone up with them into the camp all around, even they {joined the Israelites}<note>Literally "were with Israel"</note> who were with Saul and Jonathan.</verse>
    <verse num="22">All the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines had fled, so even they pursued them closely in the battle.</verse>
    <verse num="23">So on that day Yahweh delivered Israel, and the battle shifted to Beth Aven. </verse>
    <verse num="24">Now the men of Israel were hard pressed on that day, because Saul had made the army take an oath, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats <transChange type="added">any</transChange> food until evening, when I will have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the army tasted <transChange type="added">any</transChange> food.</verse>
    <verse num="25">(Now all <transChange type="added">the people of</transChange> the land used to go into the forest, for there was honey on the surface of the ground.)</verse>
    <verse num="26">When the army came to the forest, look! <transChange type="added">There was</transChange> honey flowing, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the army was afraid of the solemn oath. </verse>
    <verse num="27">However, Jonathan had not heard about the oath of his father with the army, so he extended the end of the staff which was in his hand, and he dipped it into the honeycomb.<note>Hebrew "the honeycomb of the honey"</note> Then he put his hand to his mouth and his eyes gleamed.<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "saw"; the reading tradition (Qere) reads "gleamed"</note></verse>
    <verse num="28">Then a man from the army informed <transChange type="added">him</transChange> and said, "Your father made the army swear a solemn <transChange type="added">oath</transChange>, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food today,'" so the army <transChange type="added">is</transChange> exhausted.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then Jonathan said, "My father has brought trouble on the land! See now that my eyes have brightened because I have tasted a little of this honey.</verse>
    <verse num="30">{How much more could have been done}<note>Literally "even that if"</note> if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder of their enemies that they had found! For now the loss among <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not great."</verse>
    <verse num="31">They defeated <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines that day from Micmash to Aijalon, and the troops were very weary. </verse>
    <verse num="32">Then the troops took the plunder: they took sheep and cattle and {calves}<note>Literally "the children of cattle"</note> and slaughtered <transChange type="added">them</transChange> on the ground and the troops ate <transChange type="added">them all</transChange> with the blood.</verse>
    <verse num="33">So they reported <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to Saul, saying, "Look! The troops <transChange type="added">are</transChange> sinning against Yahweh by eating <transChange type="added">the animals</transChange> with the blood!" And he said, "You have dealt treacherously! Roll to me a large stone {today}!"<note>Literally "the day"</note></verse>
    <verse num="34">Then Saul said, "Disperse <transChange type="added">yourselves</transChange> among the troops and say to them, 'Bring to me each <transChange type="added">one</transChange> his ox and each his sheep and slaughter them in this <transChange type="added">place</transChange> and eat, but do not sin against Yahweh by eating <transChange type="added">the animals</transChange> with the blood.'" So all the troops brought <transChange type="added">them</transChange>, each <transChange type="added">leading</transChange> his ox in his hand that night, and slaughtered <transChange type="added">it</transChange> there. </verse>
    <verse num="35">Then Saul built an altar to Yahweh; {it was the first altar he built}<note>Literally "with it he began to build an altar"</note> to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Saul said, "Let us go down after <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">by</transChange> night, and let us plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave <transChange type="added">alive</transChange> a man among them." So they said, "Do all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good in your eyes." But the priest said, "Let us draw near to God here."</verse>
    <verse num="37">So Saul inquired of God, "Should I go down after <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him on that day.</verse>
    <verse num="38">Then Saul said, "Come here, all <transChange type="added">you</transChange> leaders of the people, {so that we find out}<note>Literally "and know and see"</note> what the sin was this day.</verse>
    <verse num="39">For as Yahweh lives, who delivers Israel, <transChange type="added">I swear</transChange> that even if it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Jonathan my son, {he will certainly die}!"<note>Literally "surely dying he will die"</note> But nobody from all the army answered him.</verse>
    <verse num="40">Then he said to all Israel, "You will be {on one side},<note>Literally "opposite one"</note> and I and my son Jonathan will be {on the other}."<note>Literally "opposite one"</note> And the army said to Saul, "Do <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> good in your eyes."</verse>
    <verse num="41">Then Saul said to Yahweh the God of Israel, "{Render a decision perfectly}."<note>Literally "give <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> perfect"; the LXX includes additional words not found in the Masoretic Hebrew text but included in a number of modern English versions: "If this guilt <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on me or in my son Jonathan, give Urim, but if this guilt <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in your people Israel, give Thummim"</note> Jonathan and Saul were chosen <transChange type="added">by lot</transChange> and the people went out.</verse>
    <verse num="42">Then Saul said, "Let them cast <transChange type="added">the lot</transChange> between me and my son Jonathan," and Jonathan was chosen.</verse>
    <verse num="43">So Saul said, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him and said, "I {merely tasted}<note>Literally "tasted I tasted"</note> a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die."</verse>
    <verse num="44">Then Saul said, "So may God do <transChange type="added">to me</transChange> and {more},<note>Literally "so may he add"</note> you will certainly die today, Jonathan!"</verse>
    <verse num="45">But the army said to Saul, "Must Jonathan die, who accomplished this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, not a hair from his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day." So the army ransomed Jonathan and he did not die. </verse>
    <verse num="46">Saul went up from <transChange type="added">pursuing the</transChange> Philistines, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines went to their place.</verse>
    <verse num="47">So Saul took the kingship over Israel, and he fought all around against his enemies, against Moab, against the {Ammonites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. He inflicted punishment against all who rebelled.</verse>
    <verse num="48">He acted bravely and defeated <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Amalekites and rescued Israel from the hand of those who plundered it. </verse>
    <verse num="49">Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua; the names of his two daughters <transChange type="added">were as follows</transChange>: the name of the firstborn <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Merab and the younger <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Michal.</verse>
    <verse num="50">The name of Saul's wife <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz, and the name of the commander of his army <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</verse>
    <verse num="51">Now Kish <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the father of Saul, but Ner, the father of Abner, <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the son of Abiel. </verse>
    <verse num="52">Warfare was severe against <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw {anyone who was a mighty warrior}<note>Literally "each man who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a mighty warrior"</note> or {any brave man},<note>Literally "each son of ability"</note> he {conscripted him into his service}.<note>Literally "he gathered him to him<transChange type="added">self</transChange>"</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="15">
    <verse num="1">Then Samuel said to Saul, "Yahweh sent me to anoint you as king over his people Israel. So then, {listen to the words}<note>Literally "listen to the voice of the words"</note> of Yahweh!</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'I have observed what Amalek did to Israel, {how he opposed him}<note>Literally "what he placed against him in the way"</note> when he went up from Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="3">So then, go and attack Amalek and utterly destroy all that is his! You must not spare him, but kill both man and woman, both child and nursing infant, both ox and sheep, both camel and donkey.'" </verse>
    <verse num="4">Saul summoned the army and mustered them at Telaim; two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Saul came up to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the wadi.<note>A valley that is usually dry but contains a stream during the rainy season</note></verse>
    <verse num="6">Saul said to the Kenites, "Go, leave! Withdraw from among the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you with them. You have shown loyal love to all the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites left from among <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Amalekites.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Saul defeated <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Amalekites from Havilah as one goes to Shur which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> {east of}<note>Literally "upon the face of"</note> Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="8">He captured Agag the king of Amalek alive, but all the people he utterly destroyed with the {edge}<note>Literally "mouth"</note> of the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="9">However, Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and the cattle and the second <transChange type="added">best</transChange> of the young fatlings and {all that was valuable};<note>Literally "all the good <transChange type="added">things</transChange>"</note> they were not willing to utterly destroy them. But all the possessions that were despised or worthless, they utterly destroyed. </verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the word of Yahweh came to Samuel, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="11">"I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not kept my word." {Samuel became angry},<note>Literally "it became hot for Samuel"</note> and he cried out to Yahweh all night.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul. Samuel was told, "Saul has gone to Carmel, and look, he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> setting up a monument for himself." Then he turned around and crossed over and went down to Gilgal. </verse>
    <verse num="13">When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, "May you be blessed by Yahweh! I have kept the word of Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="14">But Samuel said, "Then what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this bleating of the sheep <transChange type="added">that I hear</transChange> in my ears and the lowing of the cattle that I am hearing?"</verse>
    <verse num="15">Saul said, "They have brought them from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Amalekites; the troops spared the best of the sheep and the cattle in order to sacrifice them to Yahweh your God. But the rest we have utterly destroyed."</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop and let me tell you what Yahweh said to me last night." So he said to him, "Speak." </verse>
    <verse num="17">Samuel said, "Even though you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> small in your <transChange type="added">own</transChange> eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh has anointed you as king over Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="18">When Yahweh sent you on your way, he said to you: 'Go! You must utterly destroy the sinners, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Amalekites, and you must fight against them until you<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text reads "they"; LXX, Peshitta, and Targum read "you"</note> have destroyed them.'</verse>
    <verse num="19">Why did you not listen to the voice of Yahweh and fall with shouting on the plunder? You have done evil in the sight of Yahweh!"</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have listened to the voice of Yahweh, and I have gone on the way that Yahweh sent me! I brought Agag the king of Amalek, and the Amalekites I have utterly destroyed.</verse>
    <verse num="21">The troops took from the plunder, sheep and cattle, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God at Gilgal." </verse>
    <verse num="22">Then Samuel said, </verse>
    <verse num="23">For rebellion <transChange type="added">is like</transChange> the sin of divination; arrogance <transChange type="added">is like</transChange> iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has rejected you from <transChange type="added">being</transChange> king!"</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned because I have transgressed {the commandment of Yahweh}<note>Literally "the mouth of Yahweh"</note> and your words, for I feared the troops and I listened to their voice.</verse>
    <verse num="25">So then, please pardon my sin and return with me {so that I can worship}<note>Literally "so that I can bow down to"</note> Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="26">But Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and he has rejected you from being king over Israel!" </verse>
    <verse num="27">As Samuel turned around to go, he<note>That is, Saul</note> caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then Samuel said to him, "Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor {who is better than you}.<note>Literally "the better than you"</note></verse>
    <verse num="29">Moreover, the Glory of Israel will not break faith and will not regret, for he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not a human that he should regret."</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then he<note>That is, Saul</note> said, "I have sinned! Now please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me {so that I can worship}<note>Literally "so that I can bow down to"</note> Yahweh your God."</verse>
    <verse num="31">So Samuel returned after Saul, and Saul {worshiped}<note>Literally "bowed down to"</note> Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="32">Then Samuel said, "Bring Agag the king of Amalek out to me!" Agag came to him confidently,<note>Or "trembling"; literally "in chains/bonds" (HALOT 609 s.v. 2); the meaning here is uncertain (LXX has "trembling")</note> for Agag thought, "Surely the bitterness of death {is over}."<note>Literally "has turned aside"; other English versions follow the LXX and Peshitta and omit "has turned aside," reading "Surely the bitterness of death!"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="33">Samuel said, </verse>
    <verse num="34">Then Samuel went to Ramah and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Samuel {did not see Saul again}<note>Literally "did not add to see Saul"</note> until the day of his death, but Samuel mourned over Saul, and Yahweh regretted that he made Saul king over Israel. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="16">
    <verse num="1">Then Yahweh said to Samuel, "{How long}<note>Literally "Until when"</note> will you mourn about Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel! Fill up your horn <transChange type="added">with</transChange> oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen a king for myself among his sons."</verse>
    <verse num="2">But Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears, he will kill me." Yahweh said, "You must take a heifer from the herd {with you},<note>Literally "in/with your hand"</note> and you must say, 'I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.'</verse>
    <verse num="3">You will invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will make known to you what you must do. You will anoint for me <transChange type="added">the one</transChange> whom I tell you." </verse>
    <verse num="4">So Samuel did what Yahweh said. He came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city came trembling to meet him. They said, "{Have you come in peace}?"<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> your coming peace?"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">He said, "<transChange type="added">I come in</transChange> peace. I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." So he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. </verse>
    <verse num="6">{When they came},<note>Literally "And it happened at their coming"</note> he<note>That is, Samuel</note> saw Eliab and said, "Surely his anointed one <transChange type="added">is</transChange> before Yahweh!"</verse>
    <verse num="7">But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For <transChange type="added">God does</transChange> not <transChange type="added">see</transChange> what man sees, for a man {looks on the outward appearance},<note>Literally "sees as far as the eyes"</note> but Yahweh {looks on the heart}."<note>Literally "sees as far as the heart"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel, and he said, "This one also Yahweh has not chosen."</verse>
    <verse num="9">So Jesse made Shammah pass <transChange type="added">before Samuel</transChange>, but he said, "Yahweh also has not chosen this one."</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, "Yahweh has not chosen any of these." </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Samuel said to Jesse, "{Are all the young men here}?"<note>Literally "Are the boys finished?"</note> And he said, "The youngest still remains, but look, he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> shepherding the flock." And Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and bring him, for we cannot {sit down}<note>Literally "turn"; for "sit down" see HALOT 739 s.v. 2.c</note> until he comes here."</verse>
    <verse num="12">So he sent and brought him. Now he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> ruddy with beautiful eyes and of {handsome}<note>Literally "good"</note> appearance. And Yahweh said, "Arise, anoint him, for this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> he."</verse>
    <verse num="13">So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. Then the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon David from that day {on}.<note>Literally "and forward"</note> Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah. </verse>
    <verse num="14">Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul and an evil spirit from Yahweh tormented him.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So the servants of Saul said to him, "Look please, an evil spirit from God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> tormenting you.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Please, let our lord command your servants <transChange type="added">who are</transChange> before you! Let them seek a man skilled in playing on the lyre. {When}<note>Literally "And it will happen <transChange type="added">that</transChange>"</note> the evil spirit from God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> upon you, he can play {on it}<note>Literally "with his hand"</note> and {you will feel better}."<note>Literally "and <transChange type="added">it will be</transChange> good for you"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">So Saul said to his servants, "Please select a man {who plays a stringed instrument well}<note>Literally "doing well to play a stringed instrument"</note> and bring <transChange type="added">him</transChange> to me." </verse>
    <verse num="18">One of the servants answered and said, "Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite <transChange type="added">who is</transChange> skillful in playing a stringed instrument, a {brave man, a warrior, prudent in speech, and handsome}.<note>Literally "a hero of ability, a man of war, discerning of word, and a man of appearance"</note> And Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with him."</verse>
    <verse num="19">So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me David your son who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with the sheep."</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Jesse took a donkey <transChange type="added">loaded with</transChange> bread and a skin of wine and one {young goat}<note>Literally "kid of a goat"</note> and sent <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to Saul by the hand of David his son.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So David came to Saul and {entered his service}.<note>Literally "stood before him"</note> He<note>That is, Saul</note> loved him greatly and {he became Saul's armor bearer}.<note>Literally "he became for him a carrier of weapons"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">Then Saul sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to Jesse, saying, "Please let David stand before me, because he has found favor {in my sight}."<note>Literally "in my eyes"</note></verse>
    <verse num="23">So whenever the <transChange type="added">evil</transChange> spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the stringed instrument and play it with his hand. Then {it would bring relief}<note>Literally "it would be relieved"</note> for Saul; {he would feel better}<note>Literally "it would be good for him"</note> and the evil spirit would depart from him. </verse>

  <chapter num="17">
    <verse num="1"><transChange type="added">The</transChange> Philistines gathered their camps<note>Or "armies"</note> for battle and they were gathered <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Socoh which <transChange type="added">belongs</transChange> to Judah.

    <verse num="2">Then Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they formed ranks <transChange type="added">for the</transChange> battle to meet <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines.</verse>

    <verse num="4">Then {a champion}<note>Literally "a man of the space between"</note> went out from the camps of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, whose name was Goliath from Gath. His height was six cubits and a span.<note>A cubit was about eighteen inches and a span about nine inches, so the Masoretic Hebrew text gives the height of nine feet, nine inches. Ancient Greek versions variously give Goliath's height as four, five, or sixteen cubits.</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">A bronze helmet was on his head, and he was clothed with scale body armor; the weight of the body armor was five thousand bronze shekels.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Bronze greaves<note>Or "shin guards"</note> were on his legs,<note>Hebrew "feet"</note> and a bronze javelin <transChange type="added">was slung</transChange> between his shoulders.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam and the point of his spear <transChange type="added">weighed</transChange> six hundred iron shekels. {His shield bearer}<note>Literally "The one who carried his shield"</note> was walking in front of him. </verse>
    <verse num="8">He stood and called to the battle lines of Israel and said to them, "Why have you come out to form ranks <transChange type="added">for</transChange> battle? <transChange type="added">Am</transChange> I not the Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Commission for yourselves a man and let him come down to me.</verse>
    <verse num="9">If he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> able to fight with me and he defeats me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail over him and defeat him, then you will be our servants and you will serve us."</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the Philistine said, "I hereby defy the battle lines of Israel today! Give me a man so that we may fight each other!"</verse>
    <verse num="11">When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and very afraid. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Now David was the son of an Ephrathite.

    <verse num="13">The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone and {followed}<note>Literally "went after"</note> Saul to the battle.

    <verse num="16">Now the Philistine came forward early and late, and he took his stand <transChange type="added">for</transChange> forty days. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Jesse said to his son David, "Please take for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and bring <transChange type="added">them</transChange> quickly to the camp for your brothers.</verse>

    <verse num="19">Now Saul and they<note>That is, David's brothers</note> and all the men of Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the valley of Elah fighting <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines. </verse>
    <verse num="20">David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and he took <transChange type="added">the provisions</transChange> and went as Jesse had commanded him.

    <verse num="26">Now David had spoken to the men <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> standing with him, saying, "What will be done for the man who defeats this Philistine and removes <transChange type="added">the</transChange> disgrace from Israel? For who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this uncircumcised Philistine that he defies the battle lines of the living God?"</verse>
    <verse num="27">And the troops had spoken to him according to this word, saying, "So it will be done for the man who defeats<note>Or "kills"</note> him." </verse>
    <verse num="28">His oldest brother Eliab heard while he was speaking to the men, {and Eliab became very angry against David}<note>Literally "and the nose of Eliab became hot concerning David"</note> and said, "Why have you come down today, and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumptuousness and the evil of your heart! For you have come down in order to see the battle!"</verse>
    <verse num="29">David replied, "What have I done now? {I merely asked a question}!<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> this not a word?"</note></verse>
    <verse num="30">He turned around from him to another opposite <transChange type="added">him</transChange> and {he spoke to him in the same way},<note>Literally "and he said according to this word"</note> and the people<note>Or "troops"</note> {answered him as before}.<note>Literally "returned to him a word as the first word"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="31">Now the words which David had spoken were heard and they reported <transChange type="added">them</transChange> {to}<note>Literally "before the face/in the presence of"</note> Saul, and he summoned him.</verse>
    <verse num="32">David said to Saul, "Do not let anyone's heart fail concerning him! Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."</verse>
    <verse num="33">But Saul said to David, "You will not be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, because you are <transChange type="added">only</transChange> a boy, whereas <transChange type="added">he has</transChange> been a man of war since his childhood!"</verse>
    <verse num="34">And David said to Saul, "Your servant has been a shepherd of the flock for his father. If the lion or the bear would come and carry off a sheep from the group,</verse>
    <verse num="35">I would go out after it and strike it down and rescue <transChange type="added">the sheep</transChange> from its mouth. If it rose against me, I would grab <transChange type="added">it</transChange> by its beard and strike it down and kill it.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he defied the battle lines of the living God." </verse>
    <verse num="37">And David said, "Yahweh, who rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine!" Then Saul said to David, "Go and may Yahweh be with you!"</verse>
    <verse num="38">Then Saul clothed David with his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> fighting attire and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him <transChange type="added">with</transChange> body armor.</verse>
    <verse num="39">Then David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire, but he tried in vain to walk <transChange type="added">around</transChange>, for he was not trained to use <transChange type="added">them</transChange>. So David said to Saul, "I am not able to walk with these, because I am not trained to use <transChange type="added">them</transChange>." So David removed them.</verse>
    <verse num="40">Then he took his staff in his hand, picked out for himself five smooth stones from the wadi,<note>A valley that is usually dry but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> and he put them in his shepherd's bag, in the pouch. And with his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine. </verse>
    <verse num="41">Then the Philistine {came on, getting nearer and nearer}<note>Literally "went going and near"</note> to David, with {his shield bearer}<note>Literally "the man carrying the shield"</note> in front of him.</verse>
    <verse num="42">When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him, for he was <transChange type="added">only</transChange> a boy and ruddy with a handsome appearance.</verse>
    <verse num="43">So the Philistine said to David, "<transChange type="added">Am</transChange> I a dog, that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> coming to me with sticks?" Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</verse>
    <verse num="44">The Philistine said to David, "Come to me so that I can give your flesh to the birds of heaven and to the wild animals of the field!"</verse>
    <verse num="45">Then David said to the Philistine, "You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> coming to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I am coming to you in the name of Yahweh of hosts, the God of the battle lines of Israel, whom you have defied!</verse>
    <verse num="46">This day Yahweh will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down {and cut off your head}!<note>Literally "and I will remove your head from upon you"</note> Then I will give <transChange type="added">the</transChange> corpses of the army of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines this day to the birds of heaven and to the animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God <transChange type="added">who is</transChange> for Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="47">And all of this assembly will know that Yahweh does not rescue with sword or with spear, for the battle <transChange type="added">belongs</transChange> to Yahweh, and he will give you into our hands!" </verse>
    <verse num="48">{When}<note>Literally "And it happened that when"</note> the Philistine got up and came and drew near to meet David, David {ran quickly}<note>Literally "made quickly and he ran"</note> to the battle line to meet the Philistine.</verse>
    <verse num="49">Then David put his hand into the bag and took a stone from it and slung <transChange type="added">it</transChange>. He struck the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="50">So David prevailed over the Philistine with the sling and with the stone, and he struck down the Philistine and killed him, but there was no sword in David's hand. </verse>
    <verse num="51">Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it from its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.</verse>
    <verse num="52">The men of Israel and Judah got up, raised the war cry, and pursued <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines {as far as}<note>Literally "up to your coming <transChange type="added">to</transChange>"</note> the valley<note>So the Masoretic Hebrew text; LXX reads "Gath"</note> and up to the gates of Ekron. So the slain of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines fell on the way<note>Or "road"</note> to Shaaraim up to Gath and as far as Ekron.</verse>
    <verse num="53">Then the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> returned from pursuing <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines and plundered their camp.</verse>
    <verse num="54">And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem and placed his weapons in his tent. </verse>
    <verse num="55">Now when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, "Whose son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this young man, Abner?" And Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I do not know."</verse>
    <verse num="56">Then the king said, "You inquire whose son this young man <transChange type="added">is</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="57">So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. The head of the Philistine <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="58">Then Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" And David said, "<transChange type="added">I am</transChange> the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite." </verse>

    <verse num="1">{When}<note>Literally "And it happened as"</note> he finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan became attached to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> soul.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Saul took him on that <transChange type="added">very</transChange> day and did not allow him to return to his father's house.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> soul.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Jonathan stripped off the robe {that he was wearing}<note>Literally "which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on him"</note> and gave it to David, along with his fighting attire,<note>Hebrew "gown," in this context "fighting tunic," perhaps "armor"</note> and even his sword, his bow, and his belt. </verse>
    <verse num="5">David went out {whenever}<note>Literally "in all that"</note> Saul sent him, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> he succeeded. So Saul appointed him over the men of the war, and it {pleased}<note>Literally "was good in the eyes of"</note> all the people and even {pleased}<note>Literally "was good in the eyes of"</note> the servants of Saul.</verse>
    <verse num="6">{When they were coming back}<note>Literally "And it happened at their coming"</note> after David had returned from striking down the Philistine, the women went out from all the cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tambourines, with joy, and with three-stringed instruments.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the women sang as they danced, and they said, </verse>
    <verse num="8">{Saul became very angry},<note>Literally "And it was very hot for Saul"</note> and {this saying displeased him},<note>Literally "this thing was bad in his eyes"</note> and he thought, "They have attributed to David ten thousands, but to me they have attributed thousands! {What more can he have but the kingdom}?"<note>Literally "And still for him <transChange type="added">is</transChange> only the kingdom"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">So Saul was watching<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "sin"; the translation follows the reading tradition (Qere) which has "eyeing" or "watching"</note> David <transChange type="added">with suspicion</transChange> from that day onward. </verse>
    <verse num="10">{On}<note>Literally "And it happened from"</note> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> next day, the evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house.

    <verse num="11">Then Saul hurled the spear and thought, "{I will pin David to the wall}."<note>Literally "I will strike David and to the wall"</note> But David eluded him twice.</verse>
    <verse num="12">{Now Saul was threatened by the presence of David}<note>Literally "And Saul was afraid from the presence of David"</note> because Yahweh was with him, but had departed from Saul.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So Saul removed him {from his presence},<note>Literally "from with him"</note> and made him commander of a thousand, {so he<note>That is, David</note> marched in and out at the front of the army}.<note>Literally "for he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> going out and <transChange type="added">was</transChange> coming in before the army"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">And David was achieving success in all his ways and Yahweh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him,</verse>

    <verse num="16">However, all of Israel and Judah <transChange type="added">were</transChange> loving David, for he was going forth and marching ahead of them. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Saul said to David, "Here <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you as <transChange type="added">your</transChange> wife.

For Saul thought, "My hand will not be against him, but let the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines be against him."</verse>
    <verse num="18">But David said to Saul, "Who <transChange type="added">am</transChange> I, and <transChange type="added">who are</transChange> my relatives, the clan of my father in Israel, that I should be a son-in-law to the king?"</verse>
    <verse num="19">{But}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> at the time Saul's daughter Merab <transChange type="added">was</transChange> to be given to David, she was given <transChange type="added">instead</transChange> to Adriel the Meholathite as wife. </verse>
    <verse num="20">Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David, so they told Saul, and the matter {pleased him}.<note>Literally "was right in his eyes"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">And Saul thought, "I will give her to him, so that she may be a snare for him and the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines may be against him."

    <verse num="22">Then Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David in secret, saying, 'Look, the king <transChange type="added">is</transChange> pleased with you, and all his servants love you. So then, become a son-in-law of the king.'"</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Saul's servants spoke these words {to David privately}.<note>Literally "in the ears of David"</note> But David said, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> it insignificant {in your sight}<note>Literally "in your eyes"</note> to become the son-in-law of the king, <transChange type="added">as</transChange> I am a poor and lightly esteemed man?"</verse>
    <verse num="24">So the servants of Saul informed him, saying, "{This is what David said}."<note>Literally "According to these words David spoke"</note></verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Saul said, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> what you must say to David: '{The king desires no bride price}<note>Literally "There <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not a desire for the king for a bride price"</note> except for a hundred foreskins of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, to avenge himself on the enemies of the king.'" (Now Saul had planned to allow David to fall by the hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines.)</verse>
    <verse num="26">So his servants told David these words, and the matter {pleased David}<note>Literally "was right in the eyes of David"</note> to become the son-in-law of the king <transChange type="added">as</transChange> {the specified time had not expired}.<note>Literally "the days were not full"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="27">And David got up, and he and his men went and struck down two hundred men <transChange type="added">of the</transChange> Philistines.

    <verse num="30">Then the commanders of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines went out <transChange type="added">for battle</transChange>, and as often as they went out, David succeeded more than all the servants of Saul, and his name became very esteemed. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants about killing David, but Saul's son Jonathan {liked David very much}.<note>Literally "delighted in David very"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">So Jonathan informed David, saying, "My father Saul <transChange type="added">is</transChange> trying to kill you; now please take care! In the morning you should stay in the hiding place and conceal yourself.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I will go out and stand {at my father's side}<note>Literally "at the hand of my father"</note> in the field where you are, and I will speak about you to my father; {if I find out anything}<note>Literally "if I see and what?"</note> I will tell <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to you."</verse>
    <verse num="4">So Jonathan spoke well about David to his father Saul and said to him, "The king should not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his service for you <transChange type="added">has been</transChange> very good.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He put his life in his hand and attacked the Philistine, and Yahweh brought about a great victory for all of Israel, and you saw <transChange type="added">it</transChange> and rejoiced! Now why should you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?"</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and swore, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "the life of Yahweh"</note> he will not be put to death!"</verse>
    <verse num="7">Jonathan called to David and told him all of these words. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul and he was before him as {formerly}.<note>Literally "yesterday three days ago"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="8">War came again, so David went out and fought against <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines and {defeated them thoroughly}<note>Literally "he struck them down with a great blow"</note> so that they fled before him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then the evil spirit from Yahweh came upon Saul while he was sitting in his house <transChange type="added">with</transChange> his spear in his hand. And David <transChange type="added">was</transChange> playing a stringed instrument in <transChange type="added">his</transChange> hand.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So Saul tried {to pin David to the wall with the spear},<note>Literally "to strike with the spear on David and to the wall"</note> but {he eluded Saul},<note>Literally "he escaped from the presence of Saul"</note> so that he struck the spear into the wall, and David fled and escaped that <transChange type="added">same</transChange> night. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Saul sent messengers to David's house to guard him and to kill him in the morning, but Michal his wife told David, saying, "If {you do not save your life}<note>Literally "you are not saving your life"</note> tonight, <transChange type="added">then</transChange> tomorrow you <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> killed!"</verse>
    <verse num="12">So Michal lowered David through the window, and he went and fled and escaped.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Michal took the household god<note>Hebrew teraphim</note> and put it on the bed and put a quilt of goat's hair at its head and covered <transChange type="added">it</transChange> with the clothes.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Saul sent messengers to arrest David, but she said, "He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> ill."</verse>
    <verse num="15">So Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, so that I can kill him."</verse>
    <verse num="16">When the messengers came, {to their surprise}<note>Literally "and look"</note> the idol <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on the bed <transChange type="added">with</transChange> the quilt of goat's hair at the head.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me like this and sent away my enemy, so that he escaped?" Michal said to Saul, "He said to me, 'Let me go, why should I kill you?'" </verse>
    <verse num="18">So David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And it was told to Saul, "David <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Naioth in Ramah."</verse>
    <verse num="20">So Saul sent messengers to capture David. When they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing <transChange type="added">as</transChange> chief over them, then the Spirit of God came upon Saul's messengers, and they also prophesied.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So they told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Again Saul sent messengers a third <transChange type="added">time</transChange>, and they also prophesied.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then he also went to Ramah. When he came to the great cistern which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Secu, he asked and said, "Where <transChange type="added">are</transChange> Samuel and David?" Someone said, "Look <transChange type="added">they are</transChange> in Naioth in Ramah."</verse>
    <verse num="23">So he went there to Naioth in Ramah and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and {he walked along prophesying}<note>Literally "he went going and he prophesied"</note> until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
    <verse num="24">He also stripped <transChange type="added">off</transChange> his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay naked all that day and all night. Therefore they say, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> Saul also among the prophets?" </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, "What have I done?

    <verse num="2">And he said to him, "Far from it! You will not die!

    <verse num="3">Then David {took an oath}<note>Literally "swore"</note> again and said, "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he thought, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he worry.' But {as Yahweh lives}<note>Literally "the life of Yahweh"</note> and {as your soul lives},<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the</transChange> life of your soul"</note> surely <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> merely a step between me and death!"</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Jonathan said to David, "{Whatever you wish},<note>Literally "What your soul says"</note> I will do for you."</verse>
    <verse num="5">David said to Jonathan, "Look, tomorrow <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the new moon, and I should certainly sit with the king to eat. You must send me away so that I can hide myself in the field until the third evening.</verse>
    <verse num="6">If your father misses me at all, then you must say, 'David earnestly asked from me to run to Bethlehem his city, for {the yearly sacrifice}<note>Literally "the sacrifice of the days"</note> <transChange type="added">is</transChange> there for all the clan.'</verse>
    <verse num="7">If he says 'Good,' <transChange type="added">it will mean</transChange> peace for your servant; but if he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> very angry, know that {he has decided to do me harm}.<note>Literally "the evil has been determined from with him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">So you must show loyal love to your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you.

    <verse num="9">Then Jonathan said, "Far be it from you!

    <verse num="10">Then David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if what your father answers you <transChange type="added">is</transChange> harsh?"</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Jonathan said to David, "Come, let us go out to the field." So the two of them went out to the field. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Jonathan said to David, "Yahweh the God of Israel <transChange type="added">is my witness</transChange><note>The phrase "is my witness" is supplied based on the Syriac version</note> that I will question my father {by this time the day after tomorrow}.<note>Literally "as the time tomorrow the third"</note> And look, {if he is well disposed toward you},<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">if he is</transChange> good to David"</note> will I not send <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to you and {disclose it to you}?<note>Literally "I will reveal <transChange type="added">it to</transChange> your ear"</note></verse>

    <verse num="14">And not while I am still alive, will you not show the loyal love of Yahweh with me, that I may not die?<note>Or perhaps "and <transChange type="added">if</transChange> I die, may you not ..."</note></verse>

If I clearly say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows <transChange type="added">are</transChange> {on this side of you};<note>Literally "from you and here"</note> {bring}<note>Literally "take"</note> it,' then<note>Hebrew "and"</note> come, for <transChange type="added">it means</transChange> peace for you. And there is no problem, {as Yahweh lives}.<note>Literally "the life of Yahweh"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">But if I say this to the young man, 'Look, the arrows <transChange type="added">are</transChange> {beyond you},'<note>Literally "from you and beyond"</note> go, for Yahweh has sent you away.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And <transChange type="added">as for</transChange> the matter about which you and I spoke, look, Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> between you and me forever." </verse>
    <verse num="24">So David hid himself in the field. {When the new moon came},<note>Literally "And it was the new moon"</note> {the king was seated at the feast}.<note>Literally "the king sat at the food to eat"</note></verse>
    <verse num="25">The king sat at his seat {as before},<note>Literally "as occurrence at occurrence"</note> the seat by the wall, and Jonathan got up, and Abner sat beside Saul, but David's place was empty.</verse>
    <verse num="26">But Saul said nothing on that day, for he thought, "{Something happened to him}.<note>Literally "It <transChange type="added">is</transChange> incident"</note> He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not <transChange type="added">ceremonially</transChange> clean; surely he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not clean."</verse>
    <verse num="27">{And then}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> on the next day, the second day of the new moon, that David's place was empty. So Saul asked Jonathan his son, "Why did the son of Jesse not come either yesterday or today to the feast?"</verse>
    <verse num="28">Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked permission from me <transChange type="added">to go</transChange> up to Bethlehem.</verse>
    <verse num="29">He said, 'Send me away, please, for our clan sacrifice <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the city, and my brother commanded<note>Or "urged"</note> me <transChange type="added">to be present</transChange>. So then, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me slip away and see my brothers.' Therefore he has not come to the table of the king."</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then {Saul became angry}<note>Literally "the nose of Saul became hot"</note> at Jonathan and said to him, "<transChange type="added">You</transChange> son of a perverse, rebellious woman!<note>Or "bastard of a wayward woman" (HALOT 796)</note> Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?</verse>
    <verse num="31">For {as long as}<note>Literally "all the days which"</note> the son of Jesse <transChange type="added">is</transChange> alive on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established! So then, send and bring him to me, for {he will surely die}!"<note>Literally "he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a son of death"</note></verse>
    <verse num="32">But Jonathan answered his father Saul and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then Saul hurled his<note>Hebrew "the"</note> spear at him to kill him. So Jonathan knew {that his father had decided}<note>Literally "it was complete from with his father"</note> to kill David. </verse>
    <verse num="34">Jonathan got up from the table {enraged},<note>Literally "with burning of nose"</note> and did not eat on the second day of the new moon because he was upset about David, because his father had disgraced him.</verse>
    <verse num="35">{And then}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> in the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointment with David, and a young boy<note>Or "young servant"</note> <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="36">He said to his servant,<note>Or "boy"</note> "Run, please find the arrows that I am shooting!" The boy<note>Or "servant"</note> ran, and he shot the arrow to pass <transChange type="added">over</transChange> him.</verse>
    <verse num="37">When the boy came up to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called out after the boy and said, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> not the arrow {beyond you}?"<note>Literally "from you and beyond"</note></verse>
    <verse num="38">Then Jonathan called out after the boy, "Quick, hurry, do not linger!" And Jonathan's servant collected the arrows and came to his master.</verse>
    <verse num="39">But the boy did not know anything <transChange type="added">about this</transChange>; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</verse>
    <verse num="40">Jonathan gave his weapons to his servant and said to him, "Go, bring <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to the city."</verse>
    <verse num="41">The boy left, and then David got up from the south side,<note>So Masoretic Hebrew text; LXX reads "from the mound" (of stones)</note> and he fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed {each other}<note>Literally "each his friend"</note> and wept {together},<note>Literally "each with his friend"</note> but David <transChange type="added">wept</transChange> the most.</verse>
    <verse num="42">Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have sworn, the two of us, <transChange type="added">an oath</transChange> in the name of Yahweh, saying, "Yahweh will be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring forever."<note>In the Hebrew Bible, 1 Sam 21 begins here. 1 Samuel 20:42b-21:15 in the English Bible is 21:1-16 in the Hebrew Bible</note> Then he got up and left, and Jonathan went into the city. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">Now David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came trembling to meet David, and he said to him, "Why are you alone and there are no men with you?"</verse>
    <verse num="2">So David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a matter and said to me, 'No one must know anything about this matter <transChange type="added">on</transChange> which I am sending you, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> which I have charged you and the servants.'" So {I have arranged to meet with my servants at a certain place}.<note>Literally "I have made an appointment with my servants/young men to a place, a certain <transChange type="added">one</transChange>"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">Now then, {what do you have at hand}?<note>Literally "what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> there under your hand"</note> Give me five <transChange type="added">loaves</transChange> of bread or {whatever is here}."<note>Literally "that which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> found"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">The priest answered David and said, "There is no ordinary bread {here at hand};<note>Literally "under my hand"</note> there is only holy bread, <transChange type="added">but</transChange> only if the young men have kept themselves from women."</verse>
    <verse num="5">David answered the priest and said to him, "Indeed, women <transChange type="added">were</transChange> held back from us {as it has been when I've gone out before}.<note>Literally "as yesterday three days ago my going out"</note> And the things<note>Or possibly "equipment" or "weapons"</note> of the young men are holy when<note>Or "and"</note> it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> an ordinary journey. {How much more}<note>Literally "And even that"</note> {today}<note>Literally "the day"</note> will the things<note>Or possibly "equipment" or "weapons"</note> be holy?"</verse>
    <verse num="6">So the priest gave him <transChange type="added">the</transChange> holy <transChange type="added">bread</transChange>, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence, which was removed from before Yahweh, in order to set hot bread <transChange type="added">there</transChange> on the day when it was taken away. </verse>
    <verse num="7">Now there was a man from the servants of Saul on that day, detained before Yahweh, whose name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds.</verse>
    <verse num="8">David asked Ahimelech, "Is there not {at your disposal}<note>Literally "under your hand"</note> a spear or a sword? For I took neither my sword nor my weapons with me because the king's matter was urgent."</verse>
    <verse num="9">So the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you killed in the valley of Elah <transChange type="added">is</transChange> here, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take it for yourself, <transChange type="added">then</transChange> take it, for there is no other except it here." And David said, "There is none like it; give it to me." </verse>
    <verse num="10">So David got up and fled on that day from the presence of Saul, and he came to Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The servants of Achish said to him, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> not this David the king of the land? <transChange type="added">Is</transChange> it not for this <transChange type="added">one</transChange> that they sang in the dances, saying, 'Saul killed his thousands, but David his ten thousands?'"</verse>
    <verse num="12">{David took these words seriously}<note>Literally "David put these words in his heart"</note> and {felt severely threatened by}<note>Literally "he was very afraid from the face of"</note> Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So he changed his behavior {before them}<note>Literally "in their eyes"</note> and pretended to be mad {in their presence}.<note>Literally "in their hands"</note> He made scratches on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down into his beard.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Achish said to his servants, "Look, you see a madman! Why did you bring him to me?</verse>
    <verse num="15">Do I lack madmen that you have brought this one to act like a madman before me? Should this one enter my household?" </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">David went from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father's household<note>Or "family"</note> heard, they came down to him there.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Every man in distress and every man who had a creditor and every embittered man gathered to him, and he became {their commander}.<note>Literally "over them as commander"</note> Now there <transChange type="added">were</transChange> about four hundred men with him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And David went up from there to Mizpah of Moab. He said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and my mother {stay}<note>Literally "come/go out"</note> with you until I know what God will do for me."</verse>
    <verse num="4">So {he brought them before the king of Moab},<note>Literally "he led them into the presence of the king of Moab"</note> and they stayed with him all the days David was in the stronghold. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Gad the prophet said to David, "You should not stay in the stronghold; leave and go into the land of Judah." So David left and came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the forest of Hereth.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now Saul heard that David and the men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him had been located. Saul <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk <transChange type="added">tree</transChange> at Ramah. Now his spear <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in his hand and all his servants <transChange type="added">were</transChange> stationed around him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Saul said to the servants who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> standing around him, "Please listen, {Benjaminites}!<note>Literally "children of Benjamin"</note> Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?</verse>
    <verse num="8">For all of you have conspired against me, and {no one discloses to me}<note>Literally "there is no <transChange type="added">one</transChange> revealing <transChange type="added">to</transChange> my ear"</note> the {making}<note>Literally "cutting"</note> <transChange type="added">of an agreement</transChange> between my son and the son of Jesse! None of you have had sympathy for me or {disclosed to me}<note>Literally "revealing <transChange type="added">to</transChange> my ear"</note> <transChange type="added">that</transChange> {my son commissioned my servant against me to ambush me}<note>Literally "my son has raised my servant against me to an ambush"</note> as <transChange type="added">has been done</transChange> this day!" </verse>
    <verse num="9">But Doeg the Edomite, who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> stationed among the servants of Saul, answered and said, "I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he inquired of Yahweh for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."</verse>
    <verse num="11">So the king sent to summon Ahimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, and all his father's household, the priests who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> at Nob. So all of them came to the king.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Saul said, "Listen please, son of Ahitub." He said, "Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>, my lord."</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Saul said to him, "Why did you conspire against me, you and the son of Jesse, when you gave to him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him so that he might arise against me to ambush <transChange type="added">me</transChange> as <transChange type="added">has been done</transChange> this day?"</verse>
    <verse num="14">But Ahimelech answered the king and said, "And who among all your servants <transChange type="added">is</transChange> as faithful as David? He <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the son-in-law of the king who moves <transChange type="added">quickly</transChange> to safeguard you and is honored in your house.</verse>
    <verse num="15"><transChange type="added">Only</transChange> today I began to inquire of God for him. Far be it from me that {the king should impute anything against his servant}<note>Literally "the king will not put against his servant a matter"</note> or against my father's household, for your servant has not known any of this matter, little or much."</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then the king said, "You must certainly die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's household!"</verse>
    <verse num="17">So the king said to the runners <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> stationed around him, "Turn and kill the priests of Yahweh, because {they also support David}<note>Literally "also their hand <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with David"</note> and because they knew that he was fleeing and {did not disclose it to me}."<note>Literally "did not reveal it to his ear"; the Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "his," but the reading tradition (Qere) has "my"</note> But the servants of the king <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not willing to raise their hand to attack the priests of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn and attack the priests!" So Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests himself, and on that day he killed eighty-five men who wore <transChange type="added">the</transChange> linen ephod.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And {he put to the sword}<note>Literally "he killed with <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mouth of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sword"</note> Nob, the city of the priests, from man to woman, from child to infant, and ox and donkey and sheep;<note>Or "goats"; literally, "small livestock animals"</note> <transChange type="added">all</transChange> {to the sword}.<note>Literally "with <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mouth of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sword"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="20">But, one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day that Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul. {I am responsible for the deaths of all your father's household}!<note>Literally "I have turned against all the life of your father's house"</note></verse>
    <verse num="23">Stay with me! Do not fear, because he who seeks my life seeks your life. You are in good care with me." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="23">
    <verse num="1">Now they told David, "Look, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">are</transChange> fighting in Keilah and they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> raiding the threshing floors."</verse>
    <verse num="2">So David inquired of Yahweh, saying, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" And Yahweh said to David, "Go and attack the Philistines and save<note>Or "deliver" or "rescue"</note> Keilah."</verse>
    <verse num="3">But David's men said to him, "Look, we <transChange type="added">are</transChange> afraid here in Judah. {How much more}<note>Literally "also for"</note> <transChange type="added">if</transChange> we go <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Keilah to the battle lines of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines?"</verse>
    <verse num="4">So David again inquired of Yahweh, and Yahweh answered him and said, "Get up, go down <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Keilah, for I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> giving <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines into your hand."</verse>
    <verse num="5">So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines. They drove off their livestock and {dealt them a heavy blow}.<note>Literally "he struck them with a great smiting"</note> So David saved<note>Or "delivered" or "rescued"</note> the inhabitants of Keilah. </verse>
    <verse num="6">{Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled}<note>Literally "And it happened <transChange type="added">that</transChange> at the fleeing of Abiathar son of Ahimelech"</note> to David <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Keilah, he went down <transChange type="added">with</transChange> an ephod in his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="7">When it was told to Saul that David had gone to Keilah, Saul said, "God {has given him}<note>Literally "has made him a stranger"</note> into my hand, because he has shut himself in by going into a city <transChange type="added">with</transChange> {two barred gates}.<note>Literally "two gates and a bar"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Saul then summoned all of the army for the battle, to go down <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Keilah to lay a siege against David and his men.</verse>
    <verse num="9">When David learned that Saul <transChange type="added">was</transChange> plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod here."</verse>
    <verse num="10">And David said, "O Yahweh, God of Israel, your servant has clearly heard that Saul <transChange type="added">is</transChange> seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Yahweh, God of Israel, please tell your servant!" And Yahweh said, "He will come down."</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then David said, "Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?" And Yahweh said, "They will deliver <transChange type="added">you</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="13">So David and his men got up, about six hundred men, and went out from Keilah and wandered wherever they could go. When it was told to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, {he stopped his pursuit}.<note>Literally "he ceased to go out"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="14">David remained in the wilderness, in the strongholds, and in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him {continually},<note>Literally "all the days"</note> but God did not give him into his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="15">When David realized that Saul had gone out to seek his life, David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.</verse>
    <verse num="16">So Jonathan the son of Saul got up and went to David <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Horesh, and {encouraged him}<note>Literally "he strengthened his hand"</note> through God.</verse>
    <verse num="17">He said to him, "Do not be afraid, for the hand of my father Saul will not find you. You will be king over Israel, and {I will be second to you}.<note>Literally "I shall be for you as second"</note> My father Saul knows <transChange type="added">this</transChange> also."</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then the two of them {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant before Yahweh. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went to his house. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Then <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> south of Jeshimon?</verse>
    <verse num="20">So then, O king, {whenever you want}<note>Literally "for all the wanting of your soul"</note> to come down, come down, and <transChange type="added">it will be</transChange> for us to deliver him into the hand of the king."</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Saul said to them, "May you be blessed by Yahweh, for you have shown me compassion!</verse>
    <verse num="22">Go, please, make certain again!

    <verse num="23">Look, find out all of the hiding places where he hides. Then return to me {with dependable information},<note>Literally "to being established"</note> and I will go with you. And then if he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> there in the land, then I will seek him among all the thousands of Judah."</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then they got up and went to Ziph before Saul. </verse>
    <verse num="25">And Saul and his men went to seek <transChange type="added">him</transChange>, and they told David, so he went down <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard <transChange type="added">this</transChange>, he pursued David <transChange type="added">into</transChange> the wilderness of Maon.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Saul went {on one side of the mountain},<note>Literally "from the side of the mountain from this"</note> and David and his men {went on the other side of the mountain}.<note>Literally "from the side of the mountain from this"</note> David was hurrying to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men <transChange type="added">were</transChange> closing in on David and his men to capture them.</verse>
    <verse num="27">But a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Hurry and come, because <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines have made a raid on the land!"</verse>
    <verse num="28">So Saul returned from pursuing David, and he went to confront<note>Hebrew "to meet"</note> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines. Therefore, they called that place the Rock of Division.<note>Hebrew "Sela' Hammahlekot"</note></verse>
    <verse num="29"><note>1 Sam 23:29-24:22 in the English Bible is 24:1-23 in the Hebrew Bible</note> David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of En Gedi. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="24">
    <verse num="1">When Saul returned from <transChange type="added">pursuing the</transChange> Philistines, they told him, "Look, David <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the wilderness of En Gedi."</verse>
    <verse num="2">So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and he and his men went to search <transChange type="added">for</transChange> David {in the direction of}<note>Literally "on the face of"</note> the Rocks of the Mountain Goats.<note>Hebrew "of the Jael"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">He came to the sheep pens beside the road, and a cave <transChange type="added">was</transChange> there. Then Saul went in {to relieve himself}.<note>Literally "to cover his feet"</note> Now David and his men <transChange type="added">were</transChange> sitting in the innermost part of the cave.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And David's men said to him, "Look, today <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the day about which Yahweh said to you, 'See, I am giving your enemy<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "enemies," but the reading tradition (Qere) has the singular "enemy"</note> into your hand, and you can do to him {whatever seems good to you}.'"<note>Literally "as that <transChange type="added">which is</transChange> good in your eyes"</note> So David got up and secretly cut the hem of Saul's robe.</verse>
    <verse num="5">{And then}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> afterward David {felt guilty},<note>Literally "the heart of David struck him"</note> because he had cut {the hem of Saul's robe}.<note>Literally "the hem which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> for Saul"</note></verse>
    <verse num="6">He said to his men, "Far be it from me in<note>Hebrew "from"</note> Yahweh, that I do this thing to my lord, to Yahweh's anointed one, by stretching out my hand against him! For he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the anointed one of Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="7">So David rebuked his men with the words and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul got up from the cave, and he went on his<note>Hebrew "the"</note> way. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Then David got up afterward and went out of the cave and called after Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked after him, David knelt down <transChange type="added">with his</transChange> face to the ground and bowed down.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of people who say: 'Look, David <transChange type="added">is</transChange> {seeking to do you harm}'?<note>Literally "seeking your evil"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">Look, this day your eyes have seen that Yahweh gave you today into my hand in the cave, and some said to kill you.

    <verse num="16">When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> this your voice, my son David?" And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then he said to David, "You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me the good, but I have repaid you the evil.</verse>
    <verse num="18">You have explained to me today that you have dealt well with me, how<note>Hebrew "that"</note> Yahweh delivered me into your hand but you did not kill me.</verse>
    <verse num="19">For a man has found his enemy but sent him on <transChange type="added">his</transChange> way safely. Now may Yahweh reward you with good in return for this day, for what you have done for me.</verse>
    <verse num="20">So now then, look, I know that you will certainly be king and the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So then, swear to me by Yahweh that you will not cut off my {descendants}<note>Literally "seed"</note> after me and that you will not wipe out my name from my father's house."</verse>
    <verse num="22">So David swore <transChange type="added">this on oath</transChange> to Saul, and Saul went to his house, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="25">
    <verse num="1">Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him. They buried him at his house at Ramah. Then David got up and went down to the wilderness of Paran. </verse>
    <verse num="2">Now there was a man in Maon, whose business <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Carmel. The man was very rich and {owned}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">there were</transChange> for him"</note> three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. {Now}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> the shearing of his sheep <transChange type="added">was taking place</transChange> in Carmel.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The name of the man <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Nabal,<note>The name "Nabal" means "foolish"</note> and the name of his wife <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Abigail.<note>The name "Abigail" means "my father delights"</note> Now the woman <transChange type="added">was</transChange> wise and beautiful, but the man <transChange type="added">was</transChange> stubborn and {mean},<note>Literally "bad of deeds"</note> and he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> as his heart.<note>The Masoretic Hebrew text (Kethib) reads "as his heart," whereas the reading tradition (Qere) reads "Calebite"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">David heard in the wilderness that Nabal <transChange type="added">was</transChange> shearing his sheep.</verse>
    <verse num="5">So David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, "Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal; {you will greet him in my name}.<note>Literally "you will ask for him in my name as far as peace"</note></verse>
    <verse num="6">Then you must say to him, '<transChange type="added">Long</transChange> life <transChange type="added">to you</transChange>, and {may it go well with you, with your house, and with all that is yours}.<note>Literally "you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> peace and your house <transChange type="added">is</transChange> peace and all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> yours <transChange type="added">is</transChange> peace"</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">Now I have heard that {you have shearers}.<note>Literally "shearing <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for you"</note> Now while your shepherds <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with us, we did not mistreat them, and nothing of theirs <transChange type="added">was</transChange> missing, all the days they were in Carmel.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Ask your servants<note>Or "young men"</note> and they will tell you! Let the young men<note>Or "the servants"; "young men" is used here to connect with v. 5</note> find favor in your eyes because we have come on a feast day. Please give {whatever you have on hand}<note>Literally "what your hand finds"</note> for your servants and for your son David." </verse>
    <verse num="9">So David's young men came and they spoke all these words to Nabal in the name of David. Then they waited.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But Nabal answered David's servants and said, "Who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> David? And who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the son of Jesse? Today, <transChange type="added">there</transChange> are many servants breaking away from the presence of their masters.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Should I take my bread and my water and my meat which I have slaughtered for my shearers and give <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to men whom I do not know where they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> from?</verse>
    <verse num="12">So David's young men turned on their way and returned and came and told him according to all these words.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then David said to his men, "Each man strap on his sword!" So each one strapped on his sword, and David also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage. </verse>
    <verse num="14">But a young man of the servants told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, "Look, David sent messengers from the desert to greet<note>Hebrew "bless"</note> our master, but he addressed them angrily,</verse>
    <verse num="15">even though the men <transChange type="added">were</transChange> very good to us; we were not mistreated and did not miss anything all the days we went about with them {while we were}<note>Literally "at our being"</note> in the field.</verse>
    <verse num="16">They were a wall to us both night and day, all {the days we were}<note>Literally "the days of our being"</note> with them keeping the sheep.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And so then, know and {consider}<note>Literally "see"</note> what you should do, for evil has been decided against our master and against all his household, and he <transChange type="added">is such</transChange> {a wicked man},<note>Literally "a son of uselessness"</note> {nobody can reason with him}!"<note>Literally "from speaking to him"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Abigail {quickly took}<note>Literally "hastened and took"</note> two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five prepared sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred raisin cakes, and two hundred fig cakes, and she put <transChange type="added">them</transChange> on the donkeys.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then she said to her servants, "Go ahead before me; look, I am coming after you," but she did not tell her husband Nabal.</verse>
    <verse num="20">{And then},<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> <transChange type="added">as</transChange> she <transChange type="added">was</transChange> riding on the donkey and <transChange type="added">was</transChange> going down the ravine of the mountain, David and his men <transChange type="added">were</transChange> coming down to meet her, and she met them.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Now David had said, "Surely {in vain}<note>Literally "for the vanity"</note> I guarded all that this fellow had in the desert. And nothing was missed of all that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> his, but he returned evil against me in place of good!</verse>
    <verse num="22">{May God severely punish the enemies of David}<note>Literally "May God do so to the enemies of David"; following the LXX some English versions omit the words "the enemies of"</note> and again do thus if I leave behind {anything that is his}<note>Literally "from all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for him"</note> until the morning, <transChange type="added">not even</transChange> {one male}!"<note>Literally "from one urinating against a wall"</note></verse>
    <verse num="23">When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell on her face before {David's anger},<note>Literally "the nostrils of David"</note> and she bowed down to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="24">She fell at his feet and said, "On me, my lord, <transChange type="added">be</transChange> the guilt! Please let your female servant speak {to you personally}!<note>Literally "in your ears"</note> Hear the words of your female servant!</verse>
    <verse num="25">Please do not let my lord set his heart against {this worthless man},<note>Literally "this man of wickedness"</note> Nabal; for as his name, so <transChange type="added">is</transChange> he. Nabal <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his name, and stupidity <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with him! But I, your female servant, did not see the young men<note>Or "the servants"</note> of my lord whom you sent.</verse>
    <verse num="26">So then, my lord, {as Yahweh lives and as your soul lives},<note>Literally "the life of Yahweh and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> life of your soul"</note> since Yahweh restrained you from bloodguilt {by taking matters into your own hand},<note>Literally "saving your hand for you"</note> so then, may your enemies be like Nabal, even {those who seek to do my lord harm}.<note>Literally "the seeking to my lord evil"</note></verse>
    <verse num="27">So then, this gift which your female servant has brought to my lord, may it be given to the young men {who follow my lord}.<note>Literally "the <transChange type="added">ones</transChange> going about at the feet of my lord"</note></verse>
    <verse num="28">Please forgive the transgression of your female servant, because Yahweh will certainly make a lasting house<note>That is, a lasting dynasty</note> for my lord, because my lord <transChange type="added">is</transChange> fighting the battles of Yahweh, and evil will not be found in you {as long as you live}.<note>Literally "from your days"</note></verse>
    <verse num="29">Should a man arise to pursue you and to seek your life, may the life of my lord be wrapped in the pouch<note>Or "bag"</note> of the living with Yahweh your God. But as for the life of your enemy, he will sling it from within<note>Hebrew "in the midst of"</note> the pocket of the sling!</verse>
    <verse num="30">{And then}<note>Literally "And it will happen"</note> when Yahweh has done for my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you as leader over Israel,</verse>
    <verse num="31">then this will not be an obstacle for you or a stumbling block of conscience for my lord <transChange type="added">either</transChange> by the shedding of blood without cause or by {my lord taking matters into his own hands}.<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">the</transChange> saving of my lord for himself"</note> And when Yahweh does good to my lord, then remember your female servant." </verse>
    <verse num="32">Then David said to Abigail, "Blessed be Yahweh the God of Israel who has sent you this day to meet me!</verse>
    <verse num="33">And blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you who have prevented me this day from bloodguilt and <transChange type="added">from</transChange> delivering myself by my own hand.</verse>
    <verse num="34">But {as Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "the life of Yahweh"</note> the God of Israel who has prevented me from harming you, if you had not hurried and come to meet me, surely there would not have been {one male}<note>Literally "one urinating against a wall"</note> left alive for Nabal by the light of morning!"</verse>
    <verse num="35">Then David took from her hand what she had brought for him, and he said to her, "Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to your voice, and I have {granted your request}."<note>Literally "lifted up your face"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="36">Then Abigail went to Nabal, and look, {he was holding a feast}<note>Literally "a feast <transChange type="added">was</transChange> for him"</note> in his house like the feast of the king. {Nabal was enjoying himself},<note>Literally "the heart of Nabal <transChange type="added">was</transChange> good on him"</note> and he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> very drunk, so she did not tell him a thing, {nothing at all},<note>Literally "small or large"</note> until the light of morning.</verse>
    <verse num="37">{And then}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> in the morning when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these words. Then his heart died {within him},<note>Literally "in his midst"</note> and he became like a stone.</verse>
    <verse num="38">{And then},<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> about ten days later, Yahweh struck Nabal and he died. </verse>
    <verse num="39">When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, "Blessed be Yahweh who has vindicated the case of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and he has kept back his servant from evil; but Yahweh has returned the evil of Nabal on his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> head." Then David sent and spoke with Abigail to take her for his wife.</verse>
    <verse num="40">So the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, and they spoke to her, saying, "David has sent us to you to take you for his wife."</verse>
    <verse num="41">She got up and bowed down <transChange type="added">with</transChange> her face to the ground and said, "Here is your female servant, as a slave to wash the feet of my lord's servants."</verse>
    <verse num="42">Then Abigail {quickly got up}<note>Literally "hastened and got up"</note> and rode on the donkey, <transChange type="added">along with</transChange> five of her maidservants who {attended her},<note>Literally "the <transChange type="added">ones</transChange> going about at her feet"</note> and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife. </verse>
    <verse num="43">David had also taken Ahinoam from Jezreel, and both of them became his wives.</verse>
    <verse num="44">(Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> from Gallim.) </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="26">
    <verse num="1">The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah opposite Jeshimon?"</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then Saul got up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. </verse>
    <verse num="3">Now Saul was on the hill of Hakilah, which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> opposite Jeshimon by the road, but David was staying in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had come to the wilderness after him,</verse>
    <verse num="4">David sent spies, and he learned that Saul had come {for certain}.<note>Literally "to be established"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">Then David got up and came to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul <transChange type="added">was</transChange> lying down, {as well as}<note>Literally "and"</note> Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. (Now Saul <transChange type="added">was</transChange> lying in the encampment, and the army <transChange type="added">was</transChange> encamping around him.) </verse>
    <verse num="6">David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah the brother of Joab, saying, "Who will go down with me to Saul, in the camp?" And Abishai said, "I will go down with you."</verse>
    <verse num="7">So David and Abishai came to the army <transChange type="added">by</transChange> night, and {there was}<note>Literally "look" or "behold"</note> Saul lying asleep in the encampment with<note>Hebrew "and"</note> his spear thrust into the ground near his head, and Abner and the army <transChange type="added">were</transChange> lying all around him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then Abishai said to David, "God has handed over your enemy into your hand today! So then, {please let me pin him to the ground with the spear}<note>Literally "let me strike him please with the spear and in the ground"</note> {one time},<note>Literally "one occurrence"</note> and {I will not strike him twice}."<note>Literally "I will not repeat for him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">But David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy<note>Or "kill"</note> him! For who has stretched out his hand against Yahweh's anointed one and remained blameless?"</verse>
    <verse num="10">And David said, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> {certainly}<note>Literally "if surely"</note> Yahweh will strike him, or his day will come and he will die, or he will go down in the battle and {perish}.<note>Literally "will be carried away"</note></verse>
    <verse num="11">{Yahweh forbid me}<note>Literally "Far be it from me from Yahweh"</note> from stretching out my hand against Yahweh's anointed one! So then, please take the spear that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> near his head and the jar of water, and let us go."</verse>
    <verse num="12">So David took the spear and the jar of water from <transChange type="added">near</transChange> Saul's head, and they went <transChange type="added">away</transChange>. {No one saw, no one knew, and no one awakened},<note>Literally "there was not <transChange type="added">anyone</transChange> seeing and there was not <transChange type="added">anyone</transChange> knowing and there was not <transChange type="added">anyone</transChange> awakening"</note> for all of them <transChange type="added">were</transChange> sleeping because a deep sleep of Yahweh had fallen upon them. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then David went to the other side and stood on the top of the hill at a distance; the distance <transChange type="added">was</transChange> great between them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">David called out to the army and to Abner the son of Ner, "Will you not answer, Abner?" And Abner answered and said, "Who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you <transChange type="added">that</transChange> you call to the king?"</verse>
    <verse num="15">So David said to Abner, "<transChange type="added">Are</transChange> you not a man? And who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like you in Israel? Why did you not keep watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy<note>Or "to kill"</note> your lord the king.</verse>
    <verse num="16">This thing that you have done <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not good. {As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "the life of Yahweh"</note> {surely you people deserve to die}<note>Literally "you are sons of death"</note> since you have not kept watch over your lord, over Yahweh's anointed one! So then, see where the king's spear <transChange type="added">is</transChange> and the jar of water that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> near his head!"</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Saul recognized David's voice and said, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> this your voice, my son David?" And David said, "<transChange type="added">It is</transChange> my voice, my lord the king."</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then he said, "Why <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my lord pursuing after his servant? For what have I done? And what evil <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in my hand?</verse>
    <verse num="19">And so then, please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant: If Yahweh has incited you against me, may he delight in an offering; but if {it is mortals},<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">it is</transChange> the sons of humankind"</note> <transChange type="added">may</transChange> they be accursed {before}<note>Literally "to the face of"</note> Yahweh, for they have driven me away today from sharing in the inheritance of Yahweh, saying, 'Go, serve other gods!'</verse>
    <verse num="20">And so then, do not let my blood fall to the ground {away from}<note>Literally "from before"</note> the presence of Yahweh, for the king of Israel has gone out to seek a single flea, as one hunts a partridge in the mountains." </verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Saul said, "I have sinned! Come back, David my son, for I will not harm you again, because my life <transChange type="added">was</transChange> precious in your eyes this day. Look, I have acted like a fool and {have made a terrible mistake}."<note>Literally "have gone greatly astray"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">David answered and said, "Here is the king's spear; let one of the young men<note>Or "servants"</note> come over and take it.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Yahweh repays to each <transChange type="added">one</transChange> his righteousness and his faithfulness, for Yahweh gave you into my hand today, but I was not willing to stretch out my hand against Yahweh's anointed.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Look, as your life was precious in my eyes this day, may my life be great in the eyes of Yahweh, and may he rescue me from all trouble."</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Saul said to David, "Blessed are you, my son David; {you will not only do many things, but also will always succeed}!"<note>Literally "you will do many things and also always you will prevail"</note> Then David went on his way and Saul returned to his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="27">
    <verse num="1">Then David {thought to himself},<note>Literally "said to his heart"</note> "Now I will perish one day by the hand of Saul! There is nothing better for me but <transChange type="added">that</transChange> I must certainly escape to the land of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines. Then Saul will desist from searching for me further in all of the territories of Israel, and so I will escape from his hand."</verse>
    <verse num="2">So David got up and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, the king of Gath.</verse>
    <verse num="3">David settled with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each with his household.<note>Or "family"</note> David <transChange type="added">took along</transChange> his two wives Ahinoam {from Jezreel}<note>Literally "the Jezreelitess"</note> and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And it was reported to Saul that David had fled <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Gath, so {he no longer searched for him}.<note>Literally "he does <transChange type="added">Qere did</transChange> not again to seek him longer"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then David said to Achish, "Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, then let them give me a place in one of the {country towns}<note>Literally "towns of the open field"</note> that I can live there. Why should your servant live in {the royal city}<note>Literally "the city of the king"</note> with you?"</verse>
    <verse num="6">So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (Therefore, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this day.)</verse>
    <verse num="7">The number of days that David lived in the countryside of the Philistines <transChange type="added">was</transChange> one year and four months. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites, for they had been living <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the land for a long time {in the direction of}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">as</transChange> you come"</note> Shur and {as far as}<note>Literally "up to"</note> the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="9">So David struck the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive; he took the sheep,<note>Hebrew "flock," referring to either sheep or goats or both</note> the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Achish said, "Against whom have you raided today?" David said, "Against the Negev of Judah and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites and against the Negev of the Kenites."</verse>
    <verse num="11">And David did not leave alive a man or a woman to bring <transChange type="added">them back</transChange> to Gath, thinking,<note>Hebrew "saying"</note> "So that they will not report about us, saying, 'David did thus and so.'" Thus was his practice all the days that he lived in the countryside of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Achish trusted David, saying, "{He has made himself utterly hated}<note>Literally "Stinking he stink" = "he really stinks"</note> among his people in Israel, and he will be my servant forever." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="28">
    <verse num="1">{Now}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> in those days <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines gathered their forces for war to fight against Israel. So Achish said to David, "Certainly you realize that you must go out with me in the army, you and your men."</verse>
    <verse num="2">David said to Achish, "Very well, you will know what your servant can do." Achish said to David, "Very well, I will make you {my bodyguard}<note>Literally "the keeper of my head"</note> for life." </verse>
    <verse num="3">(Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him, and they had buried him in Ramah, his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> city. And Saul had expelled the mediums<note>Or "necromancers"</note> and the soothsayers from the land.)</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem, so Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.</verse>
    <verse num="5">When Saul saw the army of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Saul inquired of Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him, not by dreams or by the Urim<note>A device for revealing God's decisions; see Exod 28:30; Num 27:21; Neh 7:65; Prov 16:33</note> or by the prophets.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So Saul said to his servants, "Search for me {a woman who is a medium}<note>Literally "a woman of an owner of a spirit of the dead" (= "a woman who owns a ritual pit for summoning spirits of the dead")</note> so that I may go to her and inquire of her." His servants said to him, "Look <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> a woman who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a medium in Endor."</verse>
    <verse num="8">So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went {with two of his men}.<note>Literally "and two of <transChange type="added">his</transChange> men with him"</note> And they came to the woman <transChange type="added">by</transChange> night and he said, "Please consult a spirit for me through {the ritual pit},<note>Literally "the spirit of the dead"</note> and bring up for me <transChange type="added">the one</transChange> whom I tell you."</verse>
    <verse num="9">But the woman said to him, "Look, you know what Saul did, how he exterminated the mediums<note>Or "necromancers"</note> and the soothsayers from the land! Why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you setting a trap for my life to kill me?"</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Saul swore to her by Yahweh, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> {you will not be punished}<note>Literally "guilt will not meet you"</note> for this thing."</verse>
    <verse num="11">So the woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" He said, "Bring up Samuel for me."</verse>
    <verse num="12">When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and the woman said to Saul, "Why did you deceive me? You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> Saul!"</verse>
    <verse num="13">The king said to her, "Do not be afraid! What do you see?" And the woman said to Saul, "I see a god<note>Or "a divine being"</note> coming up from the ground!"</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then he said to her, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his appearance?" She said, "An old man <transChange type="added">is</transChange> coming up, and {he is wrapped in a robe}."<note>Literally "he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> wrapping himself <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a robe"</note> Then Saul realized that it was Samuel, and he knelt <transChange type="added">with</transChange> his face to the ground and bowed down. </verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" And Saul said, "{I am in distress}!<note>Literally "Great distress <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for me"</note> For <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">are about</transChange> to make war against me, but God has turned away from me, and he does not answer me any more, not {by the prophets}<note>Literally "by the hand of the prophets"</note> or by the dreams. So I called to you to let me know what I should do."</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Samuel said, "Why do you ask me, since Yahweh has turned away from you and has become your enemy?</verse>
    <verse num="17">Yahweh has done to you just as he spoke by my hand! Yahweh has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor, to David.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Because you {did not obey}<note>Literally "did not listen to"</note> Yahweh and did not carry out the fierce anger of his {wrath}<note>Literally "face"</note> against Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you today.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Yahweh will also give Israel with you into the hands of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> with me, and Yahweh will also give the army of Israel into <transChange type="added">the</transChange> hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines."</verse>
    <verse num="20">{Then Saul immediately fell prostrate}<note>Literally "Saul did at once and fell <transChange type="added">with</transChange> the fullness of his height"</note> to the ground, and he was very afraid because of the words of Samuel; there was no more strength in him, for he had not eaten food all day and all night.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then the woman came to Saul and realized that he was absolutely<note>Hebrew "very"</note> terrified, so she said to him, "Look, your female servant {has obeyed you},<note>Literally "has listened to your voice"</note> and I have {risked my life}.<note>Literally "I have put my life in my palm"</note> I have listened to your words that you have spoken to me.</verse>
    <verse num="22">So then, you also please listen to the voice of your female servant, and let me set before you a morsel of bread, and <transChange type="added">you</transChange> eat so that {you will have strength}<note>Literally "it will be your strength"</note> in you when you go on your<note>Hebrew "the"</note> way."</verse>
    <verse num="23">But he refused and said, "I will not eat!" However, his servants urged him, and the woman also. So he listened {to what they said},<note>Literally "their voice"</note> and he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Now the woman had a fattened bull calf in the house, {so she quickly slaughtered it}<note>Literally "and she did quickly and she slaughtered it"</note> and took flour, kneaded <transChange type="added">dough</transChange>, and baked him <transChange type="added">some</transChange> unleavened bread.</verse>
    <verse num="25">She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and went away that <transChange type="added">very</transChange> night. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="29">
    <verse num="1">Now <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines assembled all their forces at Aphek, and Israel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> encamped at the spring that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Jezreel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The rulers of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">were</transChange> passing on according to hundreds and thousands, David and his men passing on at the rear with Achish.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then the commanders of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines said, "What <transChange type="added">are</transChange> these Hebrews <transChange type="added">doing here</transChange>?" And Achish said to the commanders of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, "Is this not David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with me {for days and years}?<note>Literally "these days or these years"</note> I have not found anything <transChange type="added">threatening</transChange> in him from the day of his desertion until this day!"</verse>
    <verse num="4">But the commanders of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines were angry with him and they said to him, "Send the man back so that he might return to his place where you have assigned him! But he will not go down with us into the battle, so that he does not become an adversary to us in the battle. By what could this fellow make himself favorable to his lord? Is it not with the heads of these men?</verse>
    <verse num="5"><transChange type="added">Is</transChange> this not David about whom they sing in the dances, saying, </verse>
    <verse num="6">So Achish called David and said to him, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> certainly you were honest, and {I am pleased to have you marching with me}<note>Literally "good in my eyes your going out and your coming in with me"</note> in the campaign.<note>Or "army"</note> For I have not found any wrong in you from the day you came to me until this day, but in the eyes of the rulers, you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> not good.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So then, return and go in peace, so that you do not do {something that displeases}<note>Literally "bad/evil in the eyes of"</note> the rulers of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines."</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then David said to Achish, "But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day that I {entered your service}<note>Literally "that I was to your face" = "was before you"</note> until this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Achish answered and said to David, "I know that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> good in my eyes, like an angel of God! However, the commanders of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines have said, 'He must not go up with us into the battle.'</verse>
    <verse num="10">So then, rise early in the morning, <transChange type="added">you</transChange> and the servants of your lord who came with you. When you rise early in the morning and it is light <transChange type="added">enough</transChange> for you, leave.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So David set out early, he and his men, to leave in the morning to return to the land of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, but <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines went up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jezreel. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="30">
    <verse num="1">{Now}<note>Literally "And it happened"</note> when David and his men came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Ziklag on the third day, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Amalekites had raided <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Negev and Ziklag. When they attacked Ziklag, they burned it with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="2">They took captive the women<note>LXX adds "and all"</note> who were in it, {from the youngest to the oldest}.<note>Literally "from small and up to great"</note> They did not kill anyone, but carried <transChange type="added">them</transChange> off and went on their way.</verse>
    <verse num="3">When David and his men came to the city, {they saw},<note>Literally "and look"</note> and <transChange type="added">it</transChange> was burned with fire, and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then David and the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him raised their voices and wept until there was not <transChange type="added">enough</transChange> strength in them to weep.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Two of David's wives had been taken captive. Ahinoam {from Jezreel}<note>Literally "the Jezreelitess"</note> and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And {David was in a very precarious situation},<note>Literally "it was very pressed for David"</note> for the people spoke of stoning him, for the souls of all the people were bitter, each <transChange type="added">one</transChange> over his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God. </verse>
    <verse num="7">Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Please bring the ephod here for me." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, "Should I pursue after this band <transChange type="added">of raiders</transChange>? Will I overtake them?" He said to him, "Pursue <transChange type="added">them</transChange>, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will certainly rescue them."</verse>
    <verse num="9">So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the Wadi<note>A valley that is usually dry but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> Besor, but the rest remained.</verse>
    <verse num="10">David pursued, he and four hundred men; but two hundred men stayed because they were too exhausted to pass over the Wadi Besor. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then they found an Egyptian man in the open country and brought him to David, and they gave him food and he ate; they also gave him water.</verse>
    <verse num="12">They gave him a slice of fig cake and two raisin cakes; he ate and {this revived him},<note>Literally "his spirit returned to him"</note> because he had not eaten food or drunk water <transChange type="added">for</transChange> three days and three nights.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then David said to him, "{To whom do you belong},<note>Literally "To whom <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you"</note> and from where <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you? The young man said, "I am an Egyptian young man, a servant of an Amalekite man, but my master abandoned me because I became ill three days ago.</verse>
    <verse num="14">We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and that <transChange type="added">which belongs</transChange> to Judah and then the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire."</verse>
    <verse num="15">So David asked him, "Will you take me down to this band <transChange type="added">of raiders</transChange>?" He said, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and that you will not deliver me into my master's hand! Then I will take you down to this band."</verse>
    <verse num="16">So he took him down, and {there they were},<note>Literally "look"</note> spread out over the surface of all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all of the abundant plunder which they had taken from the land of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines and from the land of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped {except}<note>Literally "but if"</note> four hundred young men who rode <transChange type="added">off</transChange> on camels and fled.</verse>
    <verse num="18">So David recovered all that <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Amalekites had taken; David also rescued his two wives.</verse>
    <verse num="19">None of theirs <transChange type="added">was</transChange> missing {from the smallest to the greatest},<note>Literally "from the small and up to the great"</note> even sons and daughters, from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> plunder up to everything they had taken for themselves; David brought back everything.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And David took all of the sheep,<note>Hebrew "flock," referring to either sheep or goats or both</note> and the cattle they drove along in front of that livestock, and they said, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> David's plunder." </verse>
    <verse num="21">Then David came to <transChange type="added">the</transChange> two hundred men {who had been too exhausted to follow}<note>Literally "who were exhausted from going after"</note> David; they had left them behind at the Wadi<note>A valley that is usually dry but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> Besor. They went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. David came near with the people and {asked them how they were doing}.<note>Literally "asked for them as far as peace"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">Then all the corrupt and useless men among the men who went with David reacted and said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> from the plunder which we recovered, {except}<note>Literally "but if"</note> each <transChange type="added">man may take</transChange> his own wife and children. They must take them along and go!"</verse>
    <verse num="23">But David said to them, "You should not do so, my brothers, with what Yahweh has given to us! He has preserved us and has given the <transChange type="added">raiding</transChange> band that came against us into our hand.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And who would listen to you regarding this matter? For as the share of the one who went down into the battle, so the share of the one who remained with the baggage will be. They will share alike."</verse>
    <verse num="25">So<note>Or "And"</note> from that day and beyond, he made it a rule and a regulation for Israel until this day. </verse>
    <verse num="26">Then David came to Ziklag, and he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, "{Here is}<note>Literally "Look"</note> a gift for you from the plunder of the enemies of Yahweh!"</verse>
    <verse num="27"><transChange type="added">It was</transChange> for those in Bethel, for those in Ramoth of the Negev, for those in Jattir,</verse>
    <verse num="28">for those in Aroer, for those in Siphmoth, for those in Eshtemoa,</verse>
    <verse num="29">for those in Racal, for those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, for those in the towns of the Kenites,</verse>
    <verse num="30">for those in Hormah, for those in Bor Ashan, for those in Athach,</verse>
    <verse num="31">for those in Hebron, and for all the places {where David and his men had roamed}.<note>Literally "where David had gone about there, he and his men"</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="31">
    <verse num="1">Now <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines <transChange type="added">were</transChange> fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines, and they fell slain on Mount Gilboa.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malki-Shua, the sons of Saul.</verse>
    <verse num="3">{Saul was in the thick of the battle},<note>Literally "The battle weighed heavily on Saul"</note> and {the archers}<note>Literally "the shooters, the men with the bow"</note> spotted<note>Hebrew "found"</note> him, and he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> badly wounded by the archers.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Saul said to {his armor bearer},<note>Literally "the carrier of his weapons"</note> "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, so that these uncircumcised do not come and thrust me through and make a fool of me!" But {his armor bearer}<note>Literally "the carrier of his weapons"</note> <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not willing <transChange type="added">to do so</transChange> because he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> very afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And when {his armor bearer}<note>Literally "the carrier of his weapons"</note> saw that Saul <transChange type="added">was</transChange> dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">So Saul died, and his three sons, {his armor bearer},<note>Literally "the carrier of his weapons"</note> <transChange type="added">and</transChange> all his men together that <transChange type="added">same</transChange> day. </verse>
    <verse num="7">And when the men of Israel who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> on the other side of the valley and <transChange type="added">those</transChange> who were beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the towns and fled. Thus <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines came and lived in them. </verse>
    <verse num="8">{And then}<note>Literally, "And it happened"</note> the next day, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines came to strip the dead and they found Saul and his three sons lying <transChange type="added">dead</transChange> on Mount Gilboa.</verse>
    <verse num="9">So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor. Then they sent <transChange type="added">messengers</transChange> around in the land of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines to proclaim <transChange type="added">victory in</transChange> the temples<note>Or "houses"</note> of their idols and <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the people.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And they put his armor <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the temple<note>Or "house"</note> of the Ashtoreth,<note>Hebrew plural "Ashtaroth" (Ashtoreth was the female consort of Ba'al)</note> and they fastened his corpse to the wall of Beth Shan.</verse>

    <verse num="12">all of {the valiant men}<note>Literally "the men of ability"</note> set out and went all night and took the corpse of Saul and the corpses of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan, and they came to Jabesh and burned them there.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then they took their bones and buried <transChange type="added">them</transChange> under the tamarisk in Jabesh, and they fasted <transChange type="added">for</transChange> seven days. </verse>
