    <verse num="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </verse>
    <verse num="3">Blessed <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,</verse>
    <verse num="4">who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those <transChange type="added">who are</transChange> in all affliction with the comfort with which <transChange type="added">we</transChange> ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, thus through Christ our comfort overflows also.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But if we are afflicted, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> for your comfort that is at work in the patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And our hope for you <transChange type="added">is</transChange> firm, <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as causal</note> know that as you are sharers in the sufferings, so also <transChange type="added">you will be sharers</transChange> in the comfort. </verse>
    <verse num="8">For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction that happened in the <transChange type="added">province of</transChange> Asia,<note>A reference to the Roman province of Asia (modern Asia Minor)</note> that we were burdened to an extraordinary degree, beyond <transChange type="added">our</transChange> strength, so that we were in despair even of living.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But <transChange type="added">we</transChange> ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we would not be putting confidence in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,</verse>
    <verse num="10">who delivered us from so great <transChange type="added">a risk</transChange> of death, and will deliver <transChange type="added">us</transChange>, in whom we have put our hope that he will also deliver <transChange type="added">us</transChange> again,</verse>
    <verse num="11"><transChange type="added">while</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">while</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("join in helping")</note> you also join in helping {on our behalf}<note>Literally "on behalf of us"</note> by prayer, so that thanks may be given {on our behalf}<note>Literally "on behalf of us"</note> by many persons for this gracious gift <transChange type="added">given</transChange> to us through <transChange type="added">the help</transChange> of many. </verse>
    <verse num="12">For our reason for boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, in holiness<note>Some manuscripts have "sincerity"</note> and purity of motive from God, not<note>Some manuscripts have "and not"</note> in merely human wisdom, but by the grace of God.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For we are not writing <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> else to you except what you can read or also understand. But I hope that you will understand {completely}<note>Literally "to the end"</note>,</verse>
    <verse num="14">just as you have also understood us in part, that we are your reason for boasting, just as you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> also ours in the day of our Lord Jesus. </verse>
    <verse num="15">And with this confidence, I was wanting to come to you previously, in order that you may have a second proof of my goodwill,</verse>
    <verse num="16">and through you to go to Macedonia, and to come to you again from Macedonia, and to be sent on my way by you to Judea.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Therefore, <transChange type="added">when I</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was wanting") which is understood as temporal</note> was wanting <transChange type="added">to do</transChange> this, perhaps then was I making use of vacillation? Or was I deciding what I was deciding according to the flesh, in order that with me my "yes" may be "yes" and my "no" <transChange type="added">may be</transChange> "no" <transChange type="added">at the same time</transChange>?<note>*The words "at the same time" are supplied for clarity</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">But God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> faithful, so that our word to you is not "yes" and "no."</verse>
    <verse num="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was proclaimed among you by us, by me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become "yes" and "no," but has become "yes" in him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">For as many as <transChange type="added">are the</transChange> promises of God, in him <transChange type="added">they are</transChange> "yes"; therefore also through him <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the "amen" to the glory of God through us.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Now the one who establishes us together with you in Christ and who anoints us <transChange type="added">is</transChange> God,</verse>
    <verse num="22"><transChange type="added">who</transChange> also sealed us and gave the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts. </verse>
    <verse num="23">But I call upon God <transChange type="added">as</transChange> witness against my life, that <transChange type="added">in order to</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">in order to</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("spare") which is understood as purpose</note> spare you, I did not come again to Corinth.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers for your joy, because by faith you stand firm. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">For I have decided this for myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For if I <transChange type="added">cause</transChange> you sorrow, then who will make me glad except the one who is caused to be sad by me?</verse>
    <verse num="3">And I wrote this very <transChange type="added">thing</transChange> in order that <transChange type="added">when I</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal</note> came, I would not experience sorrow from those who ought to have made me glad, <transChange type="added">because I</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have confidence") which is understood as causal</note> have confidence about you all, that my joy {belongs to all of you}<note>Literally "is of all of you"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not so that you may be caused to be sad, but so that you may know the love that I have especially for you. </verse>
    <verse num="5">But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not caused me sorrow, but {to some degree}<note>Literally "in part"</note>--{in order not to say too much}<note>Literally "in order not to burden"</note>--<transChange type="added">to</transChange> all <transChange type="added">of</transChange> you.</verse>
    <verse num="6">This punishment by the majority <transChange type="added">is</transChange> sufficient for such a person.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So then, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest somehow this person should be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Therefore I urge you to confirm <transChange type="added">your</transChange> love for him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Because for this <transChange type="added">reason</transChange> also I wrote, in order that I could know your proven character, whether you are obedient in everything.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now to whomever you forgive anything, I also <transChange type="added">do</transChange>; for indeed, whatever I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> {for your sake}<note>Literally "for the sake of you"</note> in the presence of Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="11">in order that we may not be exploited by Satan (for we are not ignorant of his schemes). </verse>
    <verse num="12">Now <transChange type="added">when I</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("arrived") which is understood as temporal</note> arrived in Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was opened for me by the Lord,</verse>
    <verse num="13">I did not experience rest in my spirit, <transChange type="added">because</transChange><note>This infinitive ("find") is understood as causal</note> I did not find Titus my brother, but saying farewell to them, I departed for Macedonia.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But thanks <transChange type="added">be</transChange> to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and who reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of him through us in every place.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,</verse>
    <verse num="16">to those on the one hand an odor from death to death, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> to those on the other hand a fragrance from life to life. And who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> qualified for these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>?</verse>
    <verse num="17">For we are not like the majority who peddle the word of God, but as from pure motives--but as from God--we speak before God in Christ. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or <transChange type="added">do we</transChange>, like some, need letters of recommendation to you or from you?</verse>
    <verse num="2">You are our letter, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by all people,</verse>
    <verse num="3">revealing that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets but on tablets of human hearts. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Now we possess such confidence through Christ toward God.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as from ourselves, but our adequacy <transChange type="added">is</transChange> from God,</verse>
    <verse num="6">who also makes us adequate <transChange type="added">as</transChange> servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. </verse>
    <verse num="7">But if the ministry of death in letters carved on stone came with glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look intently into the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was transitory,</verse>
    <verse num="8">how will the ministry of the Spirit not be even more with glory?</verse>
    <verse num="9">For if <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> glory in the ministry of condemnation, by much more will the ministry of righteousness overflow with glory.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For indeed what had been glorified has not been glorified in this case, on account of the glory that surpasses <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For if what was transitory <transChange type="added">came</transChange> with glory, by much more what remains <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with glory. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Therefore, <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as causal</note> have such a hope, we use much boldness,</verse>
    <verse num="13">and not as Moses used to place a veil over his face, in order that the sons of Israel would not stare at the end of what was transitory.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But their minds were hardened. For until this very day, the same veil remains upon the reading of the old covenant, not being uncovered, because it is done away with in Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But until today, whenever Moses is read aloud, a veil lies upon their heart,</verse>
    <verse num="16">but whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord <transChange type="added">is, there is</transChange> freedom.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And we all, with unveiled face, reflecting<note>Or "contemplating"</note> the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory into glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Because of this, <transChange type="added">since we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">since</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as causal</note> have this ministry, just as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart,</verse>
    <verse num="2">but we have renounced shameful hidden things, not behaving with craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but with the open proclamation of the truth commending ourselves to every person's conscience before God.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But if indeed our gospel is veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing,</verse>
    <verse num="4">among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they would not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus<note>Some manuscripts have "Jesus Christ"</note> <transChange type="added">as</transChange> Lord, and ourselves <transChange type="added">as</transChange> your slaves for the sake of Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For God who said, "Light will shine out of darkness,"<note>An allusion to Gen 1:3</note> <transChange type="added">is the one</transChange> who has shined in our hearts for the enlightenment of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.<note>Some manuscripts have "in the face of Jesus Christ"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="7">But we have this treasure in earthenware jars, in order that the extraordinary degree of the power may be from God and not from us.</verse>
    <verse num="8">We are afflicted in every <transChange type="added">way</transChange>, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;</verse>
    <verse num="9">persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;</verse>
    <verse num="10">always carrying around the death of Jesus in our body, in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For we who are alive <transChange type="added">are</transChange> continually being handed over to death because of Jesus, in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So then, death is at work in us, but life in you.</verse>
    <verse num="13">But <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as causal</note> have the same spirit of faith in accordance with <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> written, "I believed, therefore I spoke,"<note>A quotation from Ps 116:10</note> we also believe, therefore we also speak,</verse>
    <verse num="14"><transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal</note> know that the one who raised Jesus<note>Some manuscripts have "the Lord Jesus"</note> will also raise us together with Jesus and present <transChange type="added">us</transChange> together with you.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For all <transChange type="added">these things</transChange> {are for your sake}<note>Literally "for the sake of you"</note>, in order that the grace that is increasing through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. </verse>
    <verse num="16">Therefore we do not lose heart, but even if our outer person is being destroyed, yet our inner <transChange type="added">person</transChange> is being renewed day after day.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For our momentary light affliction is producing in us an eternal weight of glory {beyond all measure and proportion}<note>Literally "according to an extraordinary degree to an extraordinary degree"</note>,</verse>
    <verse num="18"><transChange type="added">because</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the causal genitive absolute participle ("looking at")</note> we are not looking at what is seen, but what is not seen. For what is seen <transChange type="added">is</transChange> temporary, but what is not seen <transChange type="added">is</transChange> eternal. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">For we know that if our earthly house, the tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For indeed, in this <transChange type="added">house</transChange> we groan, <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("desire") which is understood as causal</note> desire to put on our dwelling from heaven,</verse>
    <verse num="3">if indeed, even <transChange type="added">after we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">after</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have taken off") which is understood as temporal</note> have taken <transChange type="added">it</transChange> off,<note>A number of important early manuscripts read "have put <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on" here</note> we will not be found naked.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For indeed we who are in this tent groan, being burdened {for this reason, that}<note>Literally "in that"</note> we do not want to be unclothed, but to be clothed, in order that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now the one who has prepared us for this very <transChange type="added">thing</transChange> <transChange type="added">is</transChange> God, who has given us the down payment, the Spirit. </verse>
    <verse num="6">Therefore, <transChange type="added">although we are</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("confident") which is understood as concessive</note> always confident and know that <transChange type="added">while we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">while</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are at home") which is understood as temporal</note> are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord--</verse>
    <verse num="7">for we live by faith, not by sight--</verse>
    <verse num="8">so we are confident and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Therefore indeed we have as our ambition, whether at home <transChange type="added">in the body</transChange> or absent <transChange type="added">from the body</transChange>, to be acceptable to him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, in order that each one may receive back the <transChange type="added">things</transChange> through the body according to what he has done, whether good or bad. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Therefore, <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal</note> know the fear of the Lord, we are attempting to persuade people, but we are revealed to God, and I hope to be revealed in your consciences.</verse>
    <verse num="12">We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to boast about us, in order that you may have <transChange type="added">an answer</transChange> for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For if we are out of our senses, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> for God; if we are of sound mind, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> for you.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For the love of Christ controls us, <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have concluded") which is understood as causal</note> have concluded this: that one died for all; as a result all died.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he died for all, in order that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the one who died for them and was raised. </verse>
    <verse num="16">So then, from now on we know no one {from a human point of view}<note>Literally "according to the flesh"</note>, if indeed we have known Christ {from a human point of view}<note>Literally "according to the flesh"</note>, but now we know <transChange type="added">him this way</transChange> no longer.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Therefore if anyone <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Christ, <transChange type="added">he is</transChange> a new creation; the old <transChange type="added">things</transChange> have passed away; behold, new <transChange type="added">things</transChange> have come.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And all these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> <transChange type="added">are</transChange> from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation,</verse>
    <verse num="19">namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Therefore we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as <transChange type="added">if</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">if</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were imploring") which is understood as conditional</note> God were imploring <transChange type="added">you</transChange> through us. We beg <transChange type="added">you</transChange> on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</verse>
    <verse num="21">He made the one who did not know sin <transChange type="added">to be</transChange> sin on our behalf, in order that we could become the righteousness of God in him. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Now <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are fellow workers") which is understood as causal</note> are fellow workers, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For he says, </verse>
    <verse num="3"><transChange type="added">We are</transChange> giving no one an occasion for taking offense in anything, in order that our ministry will not have fault found <transChange type="added">with it</transChange>,</verse>
    <verse num="4">but commending ourselves as servants of God in every <transChange type="added">way</transChange>, in much endurance, in afflictions, in distresses, in difficulties,</verse>
    <verse num="5">in beatings, in prisons, in disturbances, in troubles, in sleepless nights, in going hungry,</verse>
    <verse num="6">in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love without hypocrisy,</verse>
    <verse num="7">in the word of truth, in the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and left hand,</verse>
    <verse num="8">through glory and dishonor, through slander and good repute, <transChange type="added">regarded</transChange> as deceivers and <transChange type="added">yet</transChange> truthful,</verse>
    <verse num="9">as unknown and <transChange type="added">yet</transChange> known completely, as dying, and behold, we go on living, as disciplined, and <transChange type="added">yet</transChange> not put to death,</verse>
    <verse num="10">as grieving, but always rejoicing, as poor, but making many rich, as having nothing, and possessing everything. </verse>
    <verse num="11">{We have spoken freely and openly}<note>Literally "the mouth of us has opened"</note> to you, Corinthians; our heart is open wide.</verse>
    <verse num="12">You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your affections.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Now the same <transChange type="added">way</transChange> <transChange type="added">in</transChange> exchange (I am speaking as to children), you open wide <transChange type="added">your hearts</transChange> also. </verse>
    <verse num="14">Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers, for what participation <transChange type="added">is there between</transChange> righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship <transChange type="added">does</transChange> light <transChange type="added">have</transChange> with darkness?</verse>
    <verse num="15">And what agreement <transChange type="added">does</transChange> Christ <transChange type="added">have</transChange> with Beliar? Or what share <transChange type="added">does</transChange> a believer <transChange type="added">have</transChange> with an unbeliever?</verse>
    <verse num="16">And what agreement <transChange type="added">does the</transChange> temple of God <transChange type="added">have</transChange> with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, </verse>
    <verse num="17">Therefore "come out from their midst and be separate," says the Lord, "and do not touch what is unclean,<note>A quotation from Isa 52:11</note> and I will welcome you,<note>A paraphrased quotation from Ezek 20:41</note></verse>

  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">Therefore <transChange type="added">since we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">since</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as causal</note> have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of body and spirit, accomplishing holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
    <verse num="2">{Make room for us in your hearts}<note>Literally "make room for us"</note>. We have wronged no one, we have ruined no one, we have defrauded no one.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I do not say <transChange type="added">this</transChange> {to condemn you}<note>Literally "for condemnation"</note>, because I have already said that you are in our hearts, so that we die together and we live together.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Great <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my confidence toward you; great <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with encouragement; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction. </verse>
    <verse num="5">For even <transChange type="added">when</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ("arrived")</note> we arrived in Macedonia, our body had no rest, but we were afflicted in every <transChange type="added">way</transChange>--quarrels outside, fears within.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But God, who comforts the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</verse>
    <verse num="7">and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort <transChange type="added">with</transChange> which he was comforted among you, <transChange type="added">because he</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("reported") which is understood as causal</note> reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For if indeed I grieved you by my letter, I do not regret <transChange type="added">it</transChange>. Even if I did regret <transChange type="added">it</transChange> (I see<note>Some manuscripts have "for I see"</note> that that letter grieved you, even though for {a short time}<note>Literally "an hour"</note>),</verse>
    <verse num="9">now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to repentance. For you were grieved according to <transChange type="added">the will of</transChange> God, so that you suffered loss in no way through us.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For grief according to <transChange type="added">the will of</transChange> God brings about a repentance <transChange type="added">leading</transChange> to salvation, not to be regretted, but worldly grief brings about death.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For behold how much diligence this very <transChange type="added">thing</transChange>, being grieved according to <transChange type="added">the will of</transChange> God, has brought about in you: what defense <transChange type="added">of yourselves</transChange>, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! In everything you have demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Consequently, even if I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong or because of the one who had been wronged, but in order that your diligence {on our behalf}<note>Literally "on behalf of us"</note> might be revealed to you before God.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Because of this we have been encouraged, and in addition to our encouragement, we rejoiced much more over the joy of Titus, because his spirit had been refreshed by all of you.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For if I have boasted anything to him about you, I have not been put to shame, but as I have spoken everything to you in truth, thus also our boasting to Titus {has proven to be true}<note>Literally "has become truth"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And his affection for you is all the more <transChange type="added">when he</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("remembers") which is understood as temporal</note> remembers the obedience of all of you as you welcomed him with fear and trembling.</verse>
    <verse num="16">I rejoice, because in everything I am completely confident in you. </verse>

  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">Now we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia,</verse>
    <verse num="2">that with a great ordeal of affliction, the abundance of their joy and the extreme depth of their poverty have overflowed to the wealth of their generosity.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I testify that <transChange type="added">they gave</transChange><note>*The words "<transChange type="added">they gave</transChange>" are not in the Greek text, but are implied</note> according to <transChange type="added">their</transChange> ability, and beyond <transChange type="added">their</transChange> ability, by their own choice,</verse>
    <verse num="4">requesting of us with much exhortation the favor and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints,</verse>
    <verse num="5">and not just as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and <transChange type="added">then</transChange> to us, by the will of God.</verse>
    <verse num="6">So we urged Titus that, just as he had previously begun <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, thus he would also complete for you this <transChange type="added">act of</transChange> grace.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But just as you excel in everything--in faith and in speaking and in knowledge and with all diligence and in the love from us <transChange type="added">that is</transChange> in you--so may you excel in this grace also.</verse>
    <verse num="8">I am not saying <transChange type="added">this</transChange> as a command, but proving the genuineness of your love by means of the diligence of others.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that <transChange type="added">although he</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as concessive</note> was rich, for your sake he became poor, in order that you, by his poverty, may become rich.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And I am giving an opinion in this <transChange type="added">matter</transChange>, because this is profitable for you who not only began previously, a year ago, to do <transChange type="added">something</transChange>, but also to want <transChange type="added">to do it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So now also complete the doing <transChange type="added">of it</transChange>, in order that just as <transChange type="added">you have</transChange> the eagerness to want <transChange type="added">to do it</transChange>, thus also <transChange type="added">you may</transChange> complete <transChange type="added">it</transChange> from <transChange type="added">what you</transChange> have.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For if the eagerness is present {according to what one has}<note>Literally "to the degree that if he might have"</note>, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> acceptable not {according to what one does not have}<note>Literally "to the degree that he might not have"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For <transChange type="added">this is</transChange> not that for others <transChange type="added">there may be</transChange> relief, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> for you difficult circumstances, but <transChange type="added">as a matter</transChange> of equality.</verse>
    <verse num="14">At the present time your abundance <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> for their need, in order that their abundance may also be for your need, so that there may be equality,</verse>
    <verse num="15">just as it is written, "The <transChange type="added">one</transChange> who <transChange type="added">gathered</transChange> much did not have too much, and the <transChange type="added">one</transChange> who <transChange type="added">gathered</transChange> little did not have too little."<note>A quotation from Exod 16:18</note> </verse>
    <verse num="16">But thanks <transChange type="added">be</transChange> to God, who has put in the heart of Titus the same devotion {on your behalf}<note>Literally "on behalf of you"</note>,</verse>
    <verse num="17">because he not only welcomed our request, but being very earnest, by his own choice he went out<note>*Or "he is going out" (if this verb is understood as an epistolary aorist)</note> to you.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And we have sent at the same time with him the brother whose praise in the gospel <transChange type="added">has become known</transChange> throughout all the churches.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And not only <transChange type="added">this</transChange>, but he was also chosen by the churches <transChange type="added">as</transChange> our traveling companion together with this gift that is being administered by us to the glory of the Lord himself and <transChange type="added">to show</transChange> our readiness <transChange type="added">to help</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="20"><transChange type="added">We are</transChange> trying to avoid this, lest anyone should find fault with us in this abundant gift that is being administered by us.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For we are taking into consideration what is honorable not only before the Lord, but also before people.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And we are sending with them our brother whom we have tested many times in many <transChange type="added">things</transChange> that he is diligent, but now much more diligent <transChange type="added">because of his</transChange> great confidence in you.</verse>
    <verse num="23">If <transChange type="added">there is a question</transChange> concerning Titus, <transChange type="added">he is</transChange> my partner and fellow worker for you. If <transChange type="added">there is a question concerning</transChange> our brothers, <transChange type="added">they are</transChange> messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Therefore show to them the proof of your love and our boasting about you {openly before}<note>Literally "to the face of"</note> the churches. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">For it is unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the ministry to the saints,</verse>
    <verse num="2">because I know your readiness <transChange type="added">to help</transChange>, <transChange type="added">concerning</transChange> which I keep on boasting to the Macedonians about you, that Achaia has been ready <transChange type="added">to help</transChange> since last year, and your zeal has stirred up the majority <transChange type="added">of them</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you would not prove to be empty in this case, so that you may be prepared just as I was saying,</verse>
    <verse num="4">lest somehow if Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we--{not to speak of you}<note>Literally "so that we do not speak about you"; some manuscripts have "so that I do not speak about you"</note>--would be humiliated in connection with this project.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Therefore I considered <transChange type="added">it</transChange> necessary to urge the brothers that they should go on ahead to you and make arrangements in advance for your generous gift that was promised previously, so this would be prepared as a generous gift and not as grudgingly granted. </verse>
    <verse num="6">Now <transChange type="added">the point is</transChange> this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Each one <transChange type="added">should give</transChange> as he has decided in his heart, not {reluctantly}<note>Literally "out of sorrow"</note> or from compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And God is able to cause all grace to abound to you, so that in everything at all times, <transChange type="added">because you</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as causal</note> have enough of everything, you may overflow in every good work.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Just as it is written, </verse>
    <verse num="10">Now the one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed, and will cause the harvest of your righteousness to grow,</verse>
    <verse num="11">being made rich in every <transChange type="added">way</transChange> for all generosity, which is producing through us thanksgiving to God,</verse>
    <verse num="12">because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but also is overflowing through many <transChange type="added">expressions of</transChange> thanksgiving to God.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Through the proven character of this service <transChange type="added">they will</transChange> glorify God because of the submission of your confession to the gospel of Christ and the generosity of <transChange type="added">your</transChange> participation toward them and toward everyone,</verse>

    <verse num="1">Now I, Paul, appeal to you myself by the humility and gentleness of Christ, who {when I am present in person}<note>Literally "to the face"</note> <transChange type="added">am</transChange> humble among you, but <transChange type="added">when I</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("am absent") which is understood as temporal</note> am absent am bold toward you--</verse>

    <verse num="8">For even if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave <transChange type="added">us</transChange> {for building you up and not for tearing you down}<note>Literally "for building up and not for tearing down of you"</note>, I will not be put to shame,</verse>
    <verse num="9">so that I do not want to appear as if I were terrifying you by my letters,</verse>

    <verse num="13">But we will not boast {beyond limits}<note>Literally "to the things immeasurable"</note>, but according to the measure of the assignment that God has assigned to us as a measure to reach even as far as you.</verse>

    <verse num="3">But I am afraid lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds may be led astray from the sincerity and the purity of <transChange type="added">devotion</transChange> to Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For if the one who comes proclaims another Jesus whom we have not proclaimed, or you receive a different spirit which you did not receive, or a different gospel which you did not accept, you put up with <transChange type="added">it</transChange> well <transChange type="added">enough</transChange>!</verse>

    <verse num="5">On behalf of such a person I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</verse>

    <verse num="7">even because of the extraordinary degree of the revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, in order that it would torment me so that I would not exalt myself.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would depart from me.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, because the<note>A majority of later manuscripts read "my"</note> power is perfected in weakness." Therefore rather I will boast most gladly in my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may reside in me.</verse>
