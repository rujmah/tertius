  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,</verse>
    <verse num="2">to Timothy, <transChange type="added">my</transChange> true child in the faith. Grace, mercy, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </verse>
    <verse num="3">Just as I urged you <transChange type="added">when I</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("traveled") which is understood as temporal</note> traveled to Macedonia, remain in Ephesus, so that you may instruct certain people not to teach other doctrine,</verse>
    <verse num="4">and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause useless speculations rather than God's plan <transChange type="added">that is</transChange> by faith.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a faith without hypocrisy,</verse>
    <verse num="6">from which some have deviated, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> have turned away into fruitless discussion,</verse>
    <verse num="7">wanting to be teachers of the law, <transChange type="added">although they</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("understand") which is understood as concessive</note> do not understand either <transChange type="added">the things</transChange> which they are saying or <transChange type="added">the things</transChange> concerning which they are speaking confidently. </verse>
    <verse num="8">But we know that the law <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good, if anyone makes use of it lawfully,</verse>
    <verse num="9">knowing this, that the law <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not given for a righteous <transChange type="added">person</transChange> but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and totally worldly, for the one who kills his father and the one who kills his mother, for murderers,</verse>
    <verse num="10">sexually immoral people, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and {whatever}<note>Literally "if anything"</note> else is opposed to sound teaching,</verse>
    <verse num="11">according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God that I was entrusted with. </verse>
    <verse num="12">{I give thanks}<note>Literally "I have thankfulness"</note> to the one who strengthens me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me faithful, placing <transChange type="added">me</transChange> into ministry,<note>Or "service"</note></verse>
    <verse num="13"><transChange type="added">although I</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as concessive</note> was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, but I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief,</verse>
    <verse num="14">and the grace of our Lord abounded with the faith and love <transChange type="added">that are</transChange> in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="15">The saying <transChange type="added">is</transChange> trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.</verse>
    <verse num="16">But because of this I was shown mercy, in order that in me foremost, Christ Jesus might demonstrate his total patience, for an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Now to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, to the only God, <transChange type="added">be</transChange> honor and glory {forever and ever}<note>Literally "to the ages of the ages"</note>. Amen. </verse>
    <verse num="18">I am setting before you this instruction, Timothy <transChange type="added">my</transChange> child, in accordance with the prophecies spoken long ago about you, in order that by them you may fight the good fight,</verse>
    <verse num="19">having faith and a good conscience, which some, <transChange type="added">because they</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have rejected") which is understood as causal</note> have rejected <transChange type="added">these</transChange>, have suffered shipwreck concerning their faith,</verse>
    <verse num="20">among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, in order that they may be taught not to blaspheme. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Therefore, I urge first of all <transChange type="added">that</transChange> petitions, prayers, requests, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> thanksgiving be made on behalf of all people,</verse>
    <verse num="2">on behalf of kings and all those who are in authority, in order that we may live a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.</verse>
    <verse num="3">This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good and acceptable before God our Savior,</verse>
    <verse num="4">who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> one God and one mediator between God and human beings, the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
    <verse num="6">who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time,</verse>
    <verse num="7">for which I was appointed a herald and an apostle--I am speaking the truth, <transChange type="added">I am</transChange> not lying--a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and dispute. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Likewise also the women should adorn themselves in appropriate clothing, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold jewelry or pearls or expensive clothing,</verse>
    <verse num="10">but with good deeds which are fitting for women who profess godliness.</verse>
    <verse num="11">A woman must learn in quietness with all submission.</verse>
    <verse num="12">But I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but {to remain quiet}<note>Literally "to be in quietness"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For Adam was formed first, then Eve,</verse>
    <verse num="14">and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, <transChange type="added">because she</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was deceived") which is understood as causal</note> was deceived, came into transgression.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But she will be saved through the bearing of children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">The saying <transChange type="added">is</transChange> trustworthy: if anyone aspires to supervision, he desires a good work.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Therefore the overseer must be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, skillful in teaching,</verse>
    <verse num="3">not addicted to wine, not a violent person, but gentle, peaceable, not loving money,</verse>
    <verse num="4">managing his own household well, having children in submission with all dignity</verse>
    <verse num="5">(but if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?),</verse>
    <verse num="6">not newly converted, lest he become conceited <transChange type="added">and</transChange> fall into the condemnation of the devil.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But <transChange type="added">he</transChange> must also have a good testimony from those outside, in order that he may not fall into disgrace and the trap of the devil. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Deacons likewise <transChange type="added">must be</transChange> dignified, not insincere, not devoted to much wine, not fond of dishonest gain,</verse>
    <verse num="9">holding the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience,</verse>
    <verse num="10">and these also must be tested first; then let them serve <transChange type="added">if they</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">if</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as conditional</note> are above reproach.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The wives<note>Or "The women"</note> likewise <transChange type="added">must be</transChange> dignified, not slanderous, temperate, faithful in all <transChange type="added">things</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing <transChange type="added">their</transChange> children and their own households well.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For those who have served well acquire a good standing for themselves, and great boldness in the faith <transChange type="added">that is</transChange> in Christ Jesus. </verse>
    <verse num="14">I am writing these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> to you, hoping to come to you in a short time.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But if I am delayed, <transChange type="added">I am writing</transChange><note>*The words "I am writing" are not in the Greek text, but are an understood repetition from the previous clause</note> in order that you may know how one must conduct oneself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and mainstay<note>Or "basis"; or "support"</note> of the truth.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And most certainly, great is the mystery of godliness: </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the last times some will depart from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,</verse>
    <verse num="2">by the hypocrisy of liars, who are seared in their own conscience,</verse>
    <verse num="3">who forbid marrying <transChange type="added">and insist on</transChange> abstaining from foods that God created for sharing in with thankfulness by those who believe and who know the truth,</verse>
    <verse num="4">because everything created by God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good and nothing <transChange type="added">is to be</transChange> rejected <transChange type="added">if it is</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">if</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("received") which is understood as conditional</note> received with thankfulness,</verse>
    <verse num="5">for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer. </verse>
    <verse num="6"><transChange type="added">By</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">by</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("teaching") which is understood as means</note> teaching these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, trained in the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed faithfully.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But reject those {worthless myths told by elderly women}<note>Literally "worthless and characteristic of an elderly woman myths"</note>, and train yourself for godliness.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For the training of the body is {somewhat}<note>Literally "for a little"</note> profitable, but godliness is profitable for everything, <transChange type="added">because it</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("holds") which is understood as causal</note> holds promise for the present life and for the <transChange type="added">life</transChange> to come.</verse>
    <verse num="9">The statement <transChange type="added">is</transChange> trustworthy and deserving of complete acceptance.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For to this <transChange type="added">end</transChange> we labor and suffer reproach,<note>Some manuscripts have "and strive"</note> because we have put our hope in <transChange type="added">the</transChange> living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of believers. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Command these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> and teach <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Let no one look down on your youth, but be an example for the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Until I come, pay attention to the <transChange type="added">public</transChange> reading,<note>Many English translations supply "of scripture" here to clarify what is to be read aloud</note> to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Do not neglect the gift <transChange type="added">that is</transChange> in you, that was granted to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Practice these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>. Be <transChange type="added">diligent</transChange><note>Literally "be in these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>," though most English versions supply a predicate here</note> in these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, in order that your progress may be evident to everyone.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Fix <transChange type="added">your</transChange> attention on yourself and on your teaching. Continue in them, for <transChange type="added">by</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">by</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("doing") which is understood as means</note> doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you. </verse>

  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Do not rebuke an older man, but appeal to <transChange type="added">him</transChange> as a father, younger men as brothers,</verse>
    <verse num="2">older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Honor widows <transChange type="added">who are</transChange> truly widows.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn to show profound respect for their own household first, and to pay back recompense to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But the widow <transChange type="added">who is one</transChange> truly, and is left alone, has put her hope in God and continues in her petitions and prayers night and day.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But the one who lives for sensual pleasure is dead <transChange type="added">even though she</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">even though</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("lives") which is understood as concessive</note> lives.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And command these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, in order that they may be irreproachable.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But if someone does not provide for his own <transChange type="added">relatives</transChange>, and especially the members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Let a widow be put on the list <transChange type="added">if she</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">if</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as conditional</note> is not less than sixty years <transChange type="added">old</transChange>, the wife of one husband,</verse>
    <verse num="10">being well-attested by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has helped those who are oppressed, if she has devoted herself to every good work.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But refuse younger widows, for whenever their physical desires lead them away from Christ, they want to marry,</verse>
    <verse num="12"><transChange type="added">thus</transChange> incurring condemnation because they have broken their former pledge.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And at the same time also, going around from house to house, they learn <transChange type="added">to be</transChange> idle, and not only idle, but also gossipy and busybodies, saying the things <transChange type="added">that are</transChange> not necessary.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Therefore I want younger <transChange type="added">widows</transChange> to marry, to bear children, to manage a household, to give the adversary no opportunity for reproach.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For already some have turned away <transChange type="added">and followed</transChange> after Satan.</verse>
    <verse num="16">If any believing woman has widows, she must help them, and the church must not be burdened, in order that it may help those <transChange type="added">who are</transChange> truly widows. </verse>
    <verse num="17">The elders who lead well must be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor by speaking and teaching.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For the scripture says, "You must not muzzle an ox <transChange type="added">while it</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">while</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("threshing") which is understood as temporal</note> is threshing,"<note>A quotation from Deut 25:4</note> and "The worker <transChange type="added">is</transChange> worthy of his wages."<note>A quotation from Luke 10:7</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Reprove those who sin in the presence of all, in order that the rest also may experience fear.</verse>
    <verse num="21">I testify solemnly before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels that you observe these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> without prejudice, doing nothing according to partiality.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Lay hands on no one hastily, and do not participate in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
    <verse num="23">(No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach and your frequent illnesses.)</verse>
    <verse num="24">The sins of some people are evident, preceding <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to judgment, but for some also they follow after <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Likewise also good works <transChange type="added">are</transChange> evident, and those considered otherwise are not able to be hidden. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">All those who are under the yoke as slaves must regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, lest the name of God and the teaching be slandered.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And those who have believing masters must not look down on <transChange type="added">them</transChange> because they are brothers, but rather they must serve, because those who benefit by their service are believers and dearly loved. </verse>
    <verse num="3">If anyone teaches other doctrine and does not devote himself to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching <transChange type="added">that is</transChange> in accordance with godliness,</verse>
    <verse num="4">he is conceited, understanding nothing, but having a morbid interest concerning controversies and disputes about words, from which come envy, strife, slanders, evil suspicions,</verse>
    <verse num="5">constant wrangling by people of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who consider godliness to be a means of gain.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But godliness with contentment is a great means of gain.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For we have brought nothing into the world, so that neither can we bring anything out.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But <transChange type="added">if we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">if</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("having") which is understood as conditional</note> have food and clothing, with these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> we will be content.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a trap and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge those people into ruin and destruction.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For the love of money is a root of all evil, by which some, <transChange type="added">because they</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("desire") which is understood as causal</note> desire <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, have gone astray from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains. </verse>
    <verse num="11">But you, O man of God, flee from these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patient endurance, gentleness.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I command you, in the sight of God who gives life to all <transChange type="added">things</transChange> and Christ Jesus who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</verse>
    <verse num="14"><transChange type="added">that</transChange> you observe the commandment without fault, irreproachable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="15">which he will make known in his own time, the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords,</verse>
    <verse num="16">the <transChange type="added">one who</transChange> alone possesses immortality, who lives <transChange type="added">in</transChange> unapproachable light, whom no human being has seen nor is able to see, to whom <transChange type="added">be</transChange> honor and eternal power. Amen. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Command those <transChange type="added">who are</transChange> rich in this present age not to be proud and not to put their hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in God, who provides us all <transChange type="added">things</transChange> richly for enjoyment,</verse>
    <verse num="18">to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, sharing freely,</verse>
    <verse num="19">storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, in order that they may take hold of <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> truly life. </verse>
    <verse num="20">O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted <transChange type="added">to you</transChange>. Turn away from pointless empty talk and contradictions of <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> falsely called knowledge,</verse>
    <verse num="21">which some, <transChange type="added">by</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">by</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("professing") which is understood as means</note> professing <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, have deviated concerning the faith.
