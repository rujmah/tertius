  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds from Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah the king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Jehoash, two years {before}<note>Literally "to the face of"</note> the earthquake. </verse>
    <verse num="2">And he said, "Yahweh roars from Zion and he utters his voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds wither and the top of Carmel dries up."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thus says Yahweh, "For three transgressions of Damascus and for four I will not revoke <transChange type="added">the punishment</transChange>,<note>Or "it"</note> because they threshed Gilead with threshing sledges of iron!</verse>
    <verse num="4">So I will send fire against Hazael's house and it will consume the citadel fortresses of Ben-Hadad.</verse>
    <verse num="5">I will break the gate bars of Damascus and I will cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven and the one who takes hold of the scepter of Beth Eden, and the people of Aram will go into exile to Kir," says Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="6">Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Gaza and for four I will not revoke <transChange type="added">the punishment</transChange>,<note>Or "it"</note> because they exiled a whole community, handing them over to Edom!</verse>
    <verse num="7">So I will send a fire against the wall of Gaza and it will devour its citadel fortresses.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod and the one who takes hold of the scepter of Ashkelon. I will also turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines will perish," says the Lord Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Tyre and for four I will not revoke <transChange type="added">the punishment</transChange>,<note>Or "it"</note> because they delivered up a whole community to Edom and they did not remember the covenant of brotherhood!</verse>
    <verse num="10">So I will send a fire against the wall of Tyre and it will devour its citadel fortresses." </verse>
    <verse num="11">Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Edom and for four I will not revoke <transChange type="added">the punishment</transChange>,<note>Or "it"</note> because he pursued his brother with the sword! He stifled his compassion and his anger tore <transChange type="added">them</transChange> apart {continually},<note>Literally "forever"</note> and he kept his rage forever.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So I will send a fire against Teman and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Bozrah." </verse>
    <verse num="13">Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Ammon and for four I will not revoke <transChange type="added">the punishment</transChange>,<note>Or "it"</note> because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to enlarge their territory!</verse>
    <verse num="14">So I will kindle a fire against the wall of Rabbah and it will devour its citadel fortresses with a war cry on the day of battle, with a storm on the day of the violent tempest.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And their king will go into exile, he and his commanders together," says Yahweh. </verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Moab and for four I will not revoke <transChange type="added">the punishment</transChange>,<note>Or "it"</note> because he burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So I will send a fire against Moab and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Kerioth, and Moab will die amid uproar, amid war cries <transChange type="added">and</transChange> amid the sound of a horn.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And I will cut off <transChange type="added">the</transChange> ruler from its midst and I will kill all of its officials with him," says Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Judah and for four I will not revoke <transChange type="added">the punishment</transChange>,<note>Or "it"</note> because they have rejected the law of Yahweh and have not kept his rules, and their lies have led them astray, {after which their ancestors walked}!<note>Literally "which their ancestors walked after them"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">So I will send a fire against Judah and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse num="6">Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Israel and for four I will not revoke <transChange type="added">the punishment</transChange>,<note>Or "it"</note> because they sell the righteous for money and the poor for a pair of sandals!</verse>
    <verse num="7">Those who trample the heads of the powerless into the dust of the ground and turn aside the way of the destitute, a man and his father {have sexual relations with}<note>Literally "go to"</note> the same girl, so that <transChange type="added">they</transChange> profane my holy name.</verse>
    <verse num="8">They stretch themselves out beside every altar on clothing taken in pledge and they drink wine, bought with fines imposed,<note>Literally "imposing a fine"</note> in the house of their God.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Yet I destroyed the Amorite {before them},<note>Literally "from the face of them"</note> {who was as tall as}<note>Literally "whose height was as the height of"</note> cedars and was as strong as the oaks. I destroyed his fruit above and his roots beneath.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and I led you in the wilderness forty years to take possession of the land of the Amorite.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And I raised up some <transChange type="added">of</transChange> your sons to <transChange type="added">be</transChange> prophets and some <transChange type="added">of</transChange> your young men to <transChange type="added">be</transChange> Nazirites. Is it not so, O {people}<note>Literally "children"</note> of Israel? <transChange type="added">This is</transChange> the declaration of Yahweh!</verse>
    <verse num="12">But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets, saying, 'You shall not prophesy.'</verse>
    <verse num="13">Look! I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> going to press <transChange type="added">you</transChange> down in your place just as a utility cart full of mature stalks of grain <transChange type="added">is pressed down</transChange>.</verse>

  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, O people of Israel, against the whole clan that I brought up from the land of Egypt:<note>Hebrew "Egypt, saying"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">"You only have I {chosen}<note>Literally "known"</note> of all the clans of the earth. Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Do two walk together unless they have met?</verse>
    <verse num="4">Does a lion roar in the forest {when he has no prey}?<note>Literally "and there is no prey to him"</note> Does a fierce, young lion cry out from his den unless he has caught <transChange type="added">something</transChange>?</verse>
    <verse num="5">Does a bird fall into a trapping net on the earth when there is no snare for it? Does a trapping net spring up from the ground unless it has certainly caught something?</verse>
    <verse num="6">Or is a horn blown in a city and people are not afraid? Or does a disaster occur in the city and Yahweh has not done <transChange type="added">it</transChange>?</verse>
    <verse num="7">Surely my Lord does not do anything unless he has revealed his secret to his servants the prophets.</verse>
    <verse num="8">A lion has roared! Who is not afraid? My Lord Yahweh has spoken, who will not prophesy?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Proclaim to the citadel fortresses in Ashdod and the citadel fortresses in the land of Egypt and say: "Gather on the mountains of Samaria and see the great panic in her midst and the oppression in her midst!"</verse>
    <verse num="10">"They do not know <transChange type="added">how</transChange> to do right," {declares Yahweh},<note>Literally "the declaration of Yahweh"</note> "those who store up violence and destruction in their citadel fortresses."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Therefore, thus says my Lord Yahweh, "A foe shall surround the land and bring down your strongholds, and your citadel fortresses shall be plundered."</verse>
    <verse num="12">Thus says Yahweh, "Just as the shepherd rescues two legs or a piece of an ear from the mouth of the lion, so shall the {people}<note>Literally "children"</note> of Israel who dwell in Samaria, with the corner of a couch and the damask of a bed."</verse>
    <verse num="13">"Listen and testify against the house of Jacob," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> my Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="14">"For on the day I punish Israel for {its transgression},<note>Literally "the transgression of Israel upon it"</note> I will also punish the altars of Bethel and the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.</verse>

  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Hear this word, <transChange type="added">you</transChange> cows of Bashan who <transChange type="added">live</transChange> on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the powerless, who crush the poor, who say to their husbands, "Bring <transChange type="added">something</transChange> so that we may drink!"</verse>
    <verse num="2">My Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness that, "Behold, the days are coming upon you {when they}<note>Literally "and he"</note> will take you away with hooks, even the last of you with fishing hooks.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And you shall leave through breaches <transChange type="added">in the wall</transChange>, each one in front of her. You will be dragged off toward Harmon,"<note>The meaning of this Hebrew word is uncertain</note> {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="4">"Come <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Bethel and transgress; <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Gilgal and {multiply transgression}!<note>Literally "increase to transgress"</note> Bring your sacrifices in the morning and your tithes on the {third day}.<note>Literally "for three of days"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">And bring a thank offering of unleavened bread, and proclaim freewill offerings, pronounce them, for so you love <transChange type="added">to do</transChange>, O {people}<note>Literally "children"</note> of Israel," <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the declaration of my Lord Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="6">"And I<note>Emphatic use of personal pronoun</note> in turn gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and lack of bread in all your places. Yet you did not return to me," <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the declaration of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="7">"And I also withheld the rain from you when <transChange type="added">there were</transChange> still three months to the harvest.

One tract of land will be rained on, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> tract of land {on which it does not rain}<note>Literally "which does not rain down on it"</note> will dry up.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So two <transChange type="added">or</transChange> three cities wandered to one city to drink water and they were not satisfied, yet you did not return to me," <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the declaration of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="9">"I struck you with blight and with mildew. Frequently the cutting locust devoured your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees, yet you did not return to me," <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the declaration of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="10">"I sent among you a plague in the manner of Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword, along with the captivity of your horses. And I made the stench of your camps go up into your nostrils, yet you did not return to me," <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the declaration of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="11">"I overthrew some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a stick snatched from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> fire, and yet you did not return to me," <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the declaration of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="12">"Therefore, thus I will do to you, <transChange type="added">O</transChange> Israel. Because I will do this to you, O Israel, prepare to meet your God!</verse>
    <verse num="13">Yes, here is the one who forms <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mountains, and the one who creates the wind, and the one who reveals to humans what his thoughts <transChange type="added">are</transChange>, and the one who treads on the heights of the earth; Yahweh, the God of hosts, <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his name!" </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Hear this word that I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> going to intone over you <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a lament, O house of Israel!</verse>
    <verse num="2">Virgin Israel has fallen and will not rise again. She is deserted on her land; there is no one to raise her up.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For thus says my Lord Yahweh, "The city that marches out <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a thousand will <transChange type="added">only</transChange> have a hundred left. And the one that marches out <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a hundred will <transChange type="added">only</transChange> have ten left for the house of Israel."</verse>
    <verse num="4">For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel, "Seek me so that you may live."</verse>
    <verse num="5">But do not seek Bethel or go <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Gilgal or cross over to Beersheba, for Gilgal will certainly go into exile and Bethel will come to disaster."</verse>
    <verse num="6">Seek Yahweh so that you may live, so that he will not break out like a fire <transChange type="added">against</transChange> the house of Joseph! And it will devour, {with none to quench}<note>Literally "and there is not one to quench"</note> <transChange type="added">it</transChange> for Bethel.</verse>
    <verse num="7"><transChange type="added">Ah,</transChange> you who turn justice into wormwood and hurl righteousness to the ground!</verse>
    <verse num="8">The one who made the Pleiades and Orion and who turns deep darkness into the morning and darkens day <transChange type="added">into</transChange> night, the one who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his name!</verse>
    <verse num="9">The one who makes destruction flash upon <transChange type="added">the</transChange> fierce, {so that}<note>Literally "and"</note> destruction comes upon <transChange type="added">the</transChange> fortification.</verse>
    <verse num="10">They hate the one who reproves in the gate and they abhor the one who speaks honestly.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Therefore, because you trample on <transChange type="added">the</transChange> poor and you take a grain tax from them, you built houses of dressed stone, but you will not live in them. You built vineyards of delightfulness, but you will not drink their wine.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For I know your transgressions <transChange type="added">are</transChange> many and your sins <transChange type="added">are</transChange> numerous, <transChange type="added">you</transChange> foes of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> righteous, those who take a bribe, and {those who}<note>Literally "they"</note> push aside <transChange type="added">the</transChange> poor <transChange type="added">ones</transChange> in the gate!</verse>
    <verse num="13">Therefore, whoever has insight will keep silent in that time, for it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a time of evil.</verse>

    <verse num="15">Hate evil and love good and establish justice in the gate; perhaps Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be gracious <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Therefore, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, my Lord, "In all <transChange type="added">of</transChange> the public squares <transChange type="added">there will be</transChange> wailing, and in all <transChange type="added">of</transChange> the streets <transChange type="added">they will say</transChange>, 'Alas, alas, alas!'

    <verse num="17">And in all <transChange type="added">of the</transChange> vineyards <transChange type="added">there will be</transChange> wailing, because I will pass in your midst," says Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="18">Alas, those who desire the day of Yahweh, why <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this for you the day of Yahweh? It <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> darkness and not light!</verse>
    <verse num="19"><transChange type="added">It will be</transChange> as <transChange type="added">if</transChange> a man fled from a lion and a bear met him; or he went <transChange type="added">into</transChange> the house and leaned his hand against the wall and a snake bit him.</verse>
    <verse num="20"><transChange type="added">Is</transChange> not the day of Yahweh darkness and not light, and pitch dark with no brightness in it?</verse>
    <verse num="21">"I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your assemblies.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Yes, <transChange type="added">even</transChange> if you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept <transChange type="added">them</transChange>, and I will not look at the fellowship offerings of your fattened animals.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Remove from me the noise of your songs, and I do not want to hear the melody of your harps!</verse>
    <verse num="24">But let justice roll on like the water, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Did you bring to me sacrifices and offering<transChange type="added">s</transChange> those forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?</verse>
    <verse num="26">And you will take up Sikkuth, your king, and Kaiwan, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And I will deport you beyond Damascus," says Yahweh--the God of hosts <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his name. </verse>

  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Alas <transChange type="added">for</transChange> those being at ease in Zion, and those who feel secure on Mount Samaria, the notables of the best of the nations! The house of Israel resorts to them.</verse>

    <verse num="5"><transChange type="added">Alas for those</transChange> who sing to the tune of the harp; like David they improvise on instruments of music.</verse>

    <verse num="8">My Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself, {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh, the God of hosts: "I abhor the pride of Jacob and I hate his citadel fortresses and I will deliver <transChange type="added">the</transChange> city and its fullness!"</verse>

    <verse num="1">This is what my Lord Yahweh showed me, and look, <transChange type="added">he</transChange> is going to form locusts at the beginning of the sprouting of the second crop, and look, after the mowings of the king.</verse>

  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">I saw my Lord standing by the altar and he said, "Strike the capitals so that the thresholds will shake, and shatter them on the head of all of them, and I will kill the rest of them with the sword. A fugitive belonging to them will not run away, and a survivor belonging to them will not escape.</verse>
    <verse num="2">If they dig into Sheol, from there my hand will take them, and <transChange type="added">even</transChange> if they climb up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> heaven, from there I will bring them down.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And <transChange type="added">even</transChange> if they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, from there I will search and will take them, and <transChange type="added">even</transChange> if they hide from before my eyes at the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the sea serpent and it will bite them.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And <transChange type="added">even</transChange> if they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword and it will kill them, and I will fix my eyes on them for harm and not for good."</verse>
    <verse num="5">And <transChange type="added">thus will do</transChange> the Lord Yahweh of hosts, who touches the earth and it melts, and all of those living in it mourn, and all of it rises like the Nile and it sinks down like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Nile of Egypt,</verse>
    <verse num="6">who builds his upper chambers in the heavens and lays the foundation of his vault on the earth, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them on the surface of the earth--Yahweh is his name.</verse>
    <verse num="7">"Are you not like the Cushites to me, O people of Israel?" {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.

    <verse num="8">Look, the eyes of my Lord Yahweh <transChange type="added">are</transChange> on the kingdom of sin, and I will destroy it from the surface of the earth. However, I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="9">"Yes, look, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> going to command and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations like one who shakes with a sieve, but not a pebble will fall <transChange type="added">to the</transChange> ground.</verse>
    <verse num="10">All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, 'Evil will not overtake or confront us.' </verse>
    <verse num="11">On that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen, and I will repair its breaches and will raise up its ruins and will build it like the days of old.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Thus they may take possession of the remnant of Edom and all the nations {who are called by my name},"<note>Literally "who my name is called over them"</note> {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh, <transChange type="added">who</transChange> does this.</verse>

    <verse num="14">And I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, and they will rebuild <transChange type="added">the</transChange> desolated cities and will inhabit <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.
