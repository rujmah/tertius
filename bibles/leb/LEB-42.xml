    <verse num="24">Now after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion <transChange type="added">for</transChange> five months, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="26">Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee {named}<note>Literally "to which the name"</note> Nazareth,</verse>
    <verse num="27">to a virgin legally promised in marriage to a man {named}<note>Literally "to whom the name"</note> Joseph of the house of David. And the name of the virgin <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Mary.</verse>

    <verse num="30">And the angel said to her, </verse>
    <verse num="31">And behold, you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son, and you will call his name Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="32">This one will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And he will reign over the house of Jacob {forever},<note>Literally "for the ages"</note> and of his kingdom there will be no end.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And Mary said to the angel, "How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?"</verse>

    <verse num="37">For {nothing will be impossible with God}."<note>Literally "every thing will not be impossible with God"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="38">So Mary said, "Behold, the Lord's female slave! May it happen to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her. </verse>
    <verse num="39">Now in those days Mary set out <transChange type="added">and</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">and</transChange>" is supplied because the previous participle ("set out") has been translated as a finite verb</note> traveled with haste into the hill country, to a town of Judah,</verse>

    <verse num="44">For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy!</verse>
    <verse num="45">And blessed <transChange type="added">is</transChange> she who believed that <transChange type="added">there</transChange> will be a fulfillment to what was spoken to her from the Lord!" </verse>
    <verse num="46">And Mary said, </verse>
    <verse num="47">and my spirit has rejoiced greatly in God my Savior,</verse>
    <verse num="48">because he has looked upon the humble state of his female slave, for behold, from now on all generations will consider me blessed,</verse>

    <verse num="51">He has done a mighty deed with his arm; he has dispersed the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
    <verse num="52">He has brought down rulers from <transChange type="added">their</transChange> thrones, and has exalted the lowly.</verse>
    <verse num="53">He has filled those who are hungry with good <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, and those who are rich he has sent away empty-handed.</verse>
    <verse num="54">He has helped Israel his servant, remembering <transChange type="added">his</transChange> mercy,</verse>
    <verse num="55">just as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his descendants {forever}."<note>Literally "for the age"</note></verse>
    <verse num="56">And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home. </verse>
    <verse num="57">Now the time came for Elizabeth that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
    <verse num="58">And her neighbors and relatives heard that {the Lord had shown his great mercy to her},<note>Literally "the Lord had made great his mercy with her"</note> and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
    <verse num="59">And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were wanting to name him {after}<note>Literally "in the name of"</note> his father Zechariah.</verse>
    <verse num="60">And his mother answered <transChange type="added">and</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">and</transChange>" is supplied because the previous participle ("answered") has been translated as a finite verb</note> said, "No, but he will be named John."</verse>
    <verse num="61">And they said to her, "There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name."</verse>
    <verse num="62">So they made signs to his father <transChange type="added">asking</transChange> what he wanted him to be named,</verse>
    <verse num="63">and he asked for a writing tablet <transChange type="added">and</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">and</transChange>" is supplied because the previous participle ("asked for") has been translated as a finite verb</note> wrote, saying, "John is his name."

    <verse num="64">And his mouth and his tongue were opened immediately, and he began to speak,<note>*The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ("began to speak")</note> praising God.</verse>
    <verse num="65">And fear came on all those who lived near them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these events were discussed.</verse>

For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him!" </verse>
    <verse num="67">And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, </verse>
    <verse num="68">"Blessed <transChange type="added">be</transChange> the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited to help and {has redeemed}<note>Literally "has done redemption for"</note> his people,</verse>
    <verse num="69">and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,</verse>
