    <verse num="1">Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice in his upper room, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Samaria, and he was injured. So he sent messengers, and he said to them, "Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, if I will survive this injury." </verse>
    <verse num="3">Then the angel of Yahweh spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, "Get up, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and speak to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'</verse>
    <verse num="4">Therefore, thus says Yahweh, 'The bed upon which you have gone, you will not come down from it, but you shall surely die.'" So Elijah went. </verse>
    <verse num="5">When the messengers returned to him, he asked them, "Why have you returned?"</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then they said to him, "A man came up to meet us, and he said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you and speak to him, "Thus says Yahweh, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub the god of Ekron? Therefore the bed upon which you have gone, you will not come down from it, for you will surely die.'" '"</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then he spoke to them, "What <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the manner of the man who came up to meet you and spoke to you all these things?"</verse>
    <verse num="8">They answered him, "A {hairy man}<note>Literally "an owner of hair"</note> with a leather belt girded around his waist." And he said, "It <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Elijah the Tishbite." </verse>
    <verse num="9">So {Ahaziah}<note>Literally "he"</note> sent to him the commander of fifty with his fifty <transChange type="added">men</transChange>, and he went up to him while he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, "<transChange type="added">O</transChange> man of God, the king says, 'Come down.'"</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Elijah answered and said to the commander of the fifty, "If I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty!" Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. </verse>
    <verse num="11">So he {again sent}<note>Literally "returned and sent"</note> another commander of fifty and his fifty <transChange type="added">men</transChange>. He answered and said to him, "<transChange type="added">O</transChange> man of God, thus says the king, 'Come down quickly!'"</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Elijah answered and said to them, "If I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty!" Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. </verse>
    <verse num="13">So he {again sent}<note>Literally "returned and sent"</note> a third <transChange type="added">time</transChange> a commander of fifty and his fifty, and the commander of the third fifty went up and came and knelt down on his knees before Elijah and entreated him. He said to him, "<transChange type="added">O</transChange> man of God, please let my life and the lives of your servants, these fifty, be precious in your eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Behold, fire from heaven came down and consumed the first two commanders of fifty and their fifties, so then let my life be precious in your eyes."</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then the angel of Yahweh spoke to Elijah, "Go down with him. Do not be afraid because of him." So he got up and went down with him to the king,</verse>
    <verse num="16">and he said to him, "Thus says Yahweh, 'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron--is it because there is no God in Israel <transChange type="added">from whom</transChange> to inquire his word?--therefore the bed upon which you went, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die.'" </verse>
    <verse num="17">So he died, according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken, and Joram became king in his place in the second year of Joram the son of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, because he had no son.</verse>
    <verse num="18">The remainder of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? </verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up in the storm <transChange type="added">to</transChange> heaven, Elijah and Elisha went from Gilgal.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Elijah said to Elisha, "Please stay here, for Yahweh has sent me up to Bethel." Elisha said, "{As Yahweh lives}<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> and {as your soul lives},<note>Literally "life of your soul"</note> I will certainly not leave you!" So they went down <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Bethel.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then the sons of the prophets who <transChange type="added">were in</transChange> Bethel came out to Elisha, and they said to him, "Do you know that Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> going to take your master {from you}<note>Literally "from over your head"</note> today?" He said, "I also know; be quiet!" </verse>
    <verse num="4">Elijah said to him, "Elisha, please stay here because Yahweh has sent me to Jericho." And he said, "{As Yahweh lives}<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> and {as your soul lives},<note>Literally "life of your soul"</note> I will certainly not leave you!" So they came to Jericho.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the sons of the prophets who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in Jericho came near to Elisha, and they said to him, "Do you know that Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> going to take your master {from you}<note>Literally "from over your head"</note> today?" He said, "I also know; be quiet!" </verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Elijah said to him, "Please stay here, because Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan." He said, "{As Yahweh lives}<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> and {as your soul lives},<note>Literally "life of your soul"</note> I will certainly not leave you!" So the two of them went on.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then fifty men from the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite <transChange type="added">them</transChange> at a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water. It divided {in two},<note>Literally "here and here"</note> and the two of them crossed over on dry land. </verse>
    <verse num="9">After they crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, "Ask what I may do for you before I am taken away from you." Then Elisha said, "Please let there come to me a double portion of your spirit."</verse>
    <verse num="10">He said, "What you ask is difficult. If you see me being taken from you, it will be so for you, but if not, it will not happen."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> walking, talking as they went. Suddenly a fiery chariot with horses of fire <transChange type="added">appeared</transChange> and separated between the two of them. Elijah went up in the storm <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the heavens</verse>
    <verse num="12">while Elisha <transChange type="added">was</transChange> watching and crying out, "My father, my father; the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!" But he could not see him any longer, and he grasped his clothes and tore them in two pieces. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then he picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen off of him, and he returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan.</verse>
    <verse num="14">He took Elijah's cloak that had fallen from upon him and struck the water. Then he said, "Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?" So he also struck the water, and it divided {in two},<note>Literally "here and here"</note> and Elisha crossed over. </verse>
    <verse num="15">When the sons of the prophets who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> at Jericho saw him from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> other side, they declared, "The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha," and they came to meet him and bowed down to him to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then they said to him, "Look, there are with your servants fifty able men. Please let them go and look for your master, lest the Spirit of Yahweh has lifted him up and thrown him on one of the mountains or into one of the valleys," but he said, "You must not send them."</verse>
    <verse num="17">But they urged him until embarrassing <transChange type="added">him</transChange>, so he said, "Send them." So they sent fifty men, and they looked for three days, but they could not find him.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then they returned to him while he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> staying in Jericho. He said to them, "Did I not tell you not to go?" </verse>
    <verse num="19">The men of the city said to Elisha, "Please now, the location of the city <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good, as my master can see, but the water <transChange type="added">is</transChange> bad and the land unproductive."</verse>
    <verse num="20">So he said, "Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then he went out to the spring of waters and threw the salt <transChange type="added">into it</transChange> there and said, "Thus says Yahweh, 'I hereby purify these waters; let there be no longer any death or unproductiveness from it.'"</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then the waters were purified until this very day according to the word of Elisha that he spoke. </verse>
    <verse num="23">Then he went up from there <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Bethel; as he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> going up along the way, young boys came out from the city and mocked at him and said to him, "Go up, baldhead; go up, baldhead!"</verse>
    <verse num="24">When he turned around and saw them, he cursed them in the name of Yahweh. Then two bears came out of the forest and mauled forty-two boys among them.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then he went from there to Mount Carmel and from there he returned <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Samaria. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Now Joram the son of Ahab had become king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. He reigned twelve years</verse>
    <verse num="2">and did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, yet not as his father or his mother, as he removed the stone pillars of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But he did cling to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin, and he did not depart from it. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he used to deliver to the king of Israel a hundred thousand male lambs and a hundred thousand wool rams.</verse>
    <verse num="5">It happened that when Ahab died, Mesha king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="6">So King Joram went out on that day from Samaria, and he mustered all of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="7">He went and sent <transChange type="added">a message</transChange> to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab for the battle?" And he said, "I will go up. {I am like you};<note>Literally "Like I am, like you are"</note> {my people are like your people};<note>Literally "like my people, like your people"</note> {my horses are like your horses}."<note>Literally "like my horses, like your horses"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Then he said, "Which way shall we go up?" And he answered, "By way of the wilderness of Edom." </verse>
    <verse num="9">So the king of Israel and the king of Judah and the king of Edom went around, a way of seven days, but there was no water for the army or for the animals which {were with them}.<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">were</transChange> at their feet"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the king of Israel said, "Aha, Yahweh has called for these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of Yahweh here that we might inquire <transChange type="added">guidance</transChange> from Yahweh?" One of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, "Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah."<note>That is, Elisha had served Elijah</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">Jehoshaphat said, "The word of Yahweh is with him." So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, "{What do we have in common}?<note>Literally "What to me and what for you"</note> Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother." Then the king of Israel said to him, "No, for Yahweh has called for these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Elisha said, "{As Yahweh of hosts lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh of hosts"</note> before whom I stand, surely if I was not {regarding the face}<note>Or "lifting the face"</note> of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would have not looked at you nor even glanced at you.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But now, bring me a musician." It happened that at the moment the musician played, the hand of Yahweh came upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="16">He said, "Thus says Yahweh, 'Make this wadi {full of cisterns},'<note>Literally "cisterns, cisterns"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">for thus says Yahweh, 'You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this wadi will be full of water; and you and all of your livestock and your animals shall drink.'</verse>
    <verse num="18">And since this is too trivial in the eyes of Yahweh, he will also give Moab into your hand,</verse>
    <verse num="19">and you shall defeat every fortified city, every choice city, and you shall fell every good tree. All of the springs of water you shall stop up, and every tract of good land you shall ruin with the stones."</verse>
    <verse num="20">It happened in the morning about the time of the <transChange type="added">morning</transChange> offering, that water was suddenly coming from the direction of Edom and the land was filled with water. </verse>
    <verse num="21">Now all of Moab had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, and all {who were fighting age and up}<note>Literally "who girded on a belt and above"</note> were called up, and they stood at the border.</verse>
    <verse num="22">When they arose early in the morning, the sun shone on the waters, and Moab saw the waters from the opposite <transChange type="added">side</transChange> as red as blood.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then they said, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> blood! Certainly the kings have fought one another, and each has killed his neighbor. Now, to the war booty, O Moab!"</verse>
    <verse num="24">But when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel stood up and killed Moab, so that they fled from before them. They came at her and defeated Moab.</verse>
    <verse num="25">The cities they tore down, <transChange type="added">on</transChange> every good tract of land they threw stones until it was filled up, every spring of water they stopped up, and every good tree they felled. They let the stone walls at Kir Hareseth remain, but the slingers surrounded and attacked it.</verse>
    <verse num="26">When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too heavy for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew the sword to break through to the king of Edom, but they were not able.</verse>
    <verse num="27">He took his firstborn son who was to become king in his place and offered him <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a burnt offering on the wall. Great wrath came upon Israel, and they withdrew from him and returned to the land. </verse>

  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">A certain woman from the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, "Your servant my husband is dead. Now you know that your servant was a fearer of Yahweh, but the creditor came to take two of my children for himself as slaves.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Elisha asked her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?" Then she said, "Your servant has nothing in the house except a jar of olive oil."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then he said to her, "Go, ask for yourself <transChange type="added">some</transChange> containers from the streets, from all your neighbors. {You must collect as many empty containers as you can}!<note>Literally "You must not collect only a few empty containers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">You must also go and shut the door behind you and your children, and you must pour out <transChange type="added">oil</transChange> into all of these containers and set the filled <transChange type="added">ones</transChange> aside."</verse>
    <verse num="5">So she went from him, and she shut the door behind her and her children. They <transChange type="added">were</transChange> bringing <transChange type="added">containers</transChange> to her, and she <transChange type="added">kept</transChange> pouring.</verse>
    <verse num="6">It happened that when the containers were full, she said to her son, "Bring near me another container," but he said to her, "There is not another container." Then the olive oil stopped flowing.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So she came and told the man of God, and he said, "Go, sell the olive oil and repay your debt. You and your sons can live on what is left over." </verse>
    <verse num="8">It happened one day that Elisha passed through to Shunem where there <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a wealthy woman, and she urged him to eat bread; so it happened each time he passed through, he would stop there to eat.</verse>
    <verse num="9">She said to her husband, "Please now, I know that he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a holy man of God who is passing {our way}<note>Literally "upon us"</note> regularly;</verse>
    <verse num="10">let us make a small enclosed room <transChange type="added">upstairs</transChange> and put a bed, table, chair, and lampstand there for him, so that when he comes to us, he can turn and stay there.</verse>
    <verse num="11">One day it happened that he came there and went to the upper room and lay down there.</verse>
    <verse num="12">He said to Gehazi his servant, "Call to this Shunammite," so he called to her, and she stood before him.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He said to him, "Please say to her, 'Look, you took all this trouble, showing care for us; what is there <transChange type="added">for me</transChange> to do for you? To speak for you to the king or to the commander of the army?'" She said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> living among my people."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then he said, "What may be done for her?" Gehazi said, "Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he said, "Call for her," so he called for her and she stood in the doorway.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he said, "At this time {next spring},<note>Literally "about that season as the time of life"</note> you <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> embracing a son." She said, "No, my lord, <transChange type="added">O</transChange> man of God! You must not tell a lie to your servant!"</verse>
    <verse num="17">But the woman conceived, and she bore a son {in the spring},<note>Literally "about that season as the time of life"</note> which Elisha had promised to her. </verse>
    <verse num="18">The child grew older, and it happened one day that he went out to his father <transChange type="added">and</transChange> to the reapers.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then he said to his father, "My head, my head!" So he said to the servant, "Carry him to his mother."</verse>
    <verse num="20">So they carried him and brought him to his mother; he sat on her lap until noon and then died.</verse>
    <verse num="21">She went up, laid him on the bed of the man of God, closed <transChange type="added">the door</transChange>, and went out behind it.</verse>
    <verse num="22">She called to her husband and said, "Please send one of the servants and one of the female donkeys for me, so that I can go quickly up to the man of God and return."</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he said, "Why are you going to him today? <transChange type="added">It is</transChange> neither the new moon nor the Sabbath!" And she said, "Peace."</verse>
    <verse num="24">She saddled the female donkey, and she said to her servant, "Drive along and go; you must not hold me back from riding, unless I tell you."</verse>
    <verse num="25">So she went and came to the man of God by Mount Carmel. It happened when the man of God saw her {at a distance},<note>Literally "from opposite"</note> he said to Gehazi his servant, "There is this Shunammite.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Now, please run to meet her and ask her, 'Is it peace for you? Is it peace for your husband? Is it peace for the boy?'" She said, "Peace."</verse>
    <verse num="27">So she came to the man of God at the mountain, and she caught hold of his feet. Then Gehazi came near to push her away, but the man of God said, "Let her alone, for her soul is bitter, and Yahweh has hidden it from me and has not told me."</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then she said, "Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say that you must not mislead me?" </verse>
    <verse num="29">Then he said to Gehazi, "Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, you must not greet them; if anyone greets you, you must not answer them. You must put my staff on the face of the boy."</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then the mother of the boy said, "{As Yahweh lives}<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> and {as your soul lives},<note>Literally "life of your soul"</note> I will surely not leave you." So he got up and went after her.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Gehazi crossed over before them, and he put the staff on the face of the boy; but there was no sound, and there was no sign of life, so he returned to meet him. He told him, saying, "The boy did not wake up." </verse>
    <verse num="32">When Elisha came to the house, here <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the boy dead, lying on his bed.</verse>
    <verse num="33">He went and closed the door behind the two of them and prayed to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Then he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his palms on his palms. As he bent down over him, the flesh of the boy became warm.</verse>
    <verse num="35">He returned and went {to and fro}<note>Literally "here first and here"</note> in the house one time, then he went up and bent over him. Then the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="36"><transChange type="added">Elisha</transChange> called to Gehazi and said, "Call this Shunammite." So he called her and she came to him; then he said, "Pick up your son."</verse>
    <verse num="37">She came and fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground; then she picked up her son and went out. </verse>
    <verse num="38">So Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now the famine <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. He said to his servant, put on the large pot and cook a stew for the sons of the prophets.</verse>
    <verse num="39">One went out to the field to gather herbs, and he found a {wild vine}<note>Literally "a vine of the field"</note> and gathered wild gourds from it <transChange type="added">and</transChange> filled his cloak. Then he came and cut them into the pot of stew, but they did not know <transChange type="added">what they were</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="40">They served the men to eat, but when they ate from the stew, they cried out and said, "There <transChange type="added">is</transChange> death in the pot, <transChange type="added">O</transChange> man of God!" They were not able to eat <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="41">Then he said, "Bring <transChange type="added">some</transChange> flour," and he threw it into the pot. He then said, "Serve the people and let them eat." There was nothing harmful in the pot. </verse>
    <verse num="42">A man came from Baal-Shalishah and brought food to the man of God: firstfruits and twenty loaves of barley bread, with ripe grain in his sack. He said, "Give <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to the people and let them eat."</verse>
    <verse num="43">Then his servant said, "How can I set this before a hundred men?" He said, "Give it to the people and let them eat, for thus Yahweh says, 'They shall eat and have some left over.'"</verse>
    <verse num="44">So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of Yahweh. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Now Naaman was the commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man before his master and {highly regarded},<note>Literally "faces were being lifted up "</note> for by him Yahweh had given victory to Aram. Now the man was a mighty warrior, <transChange type="added">but he was</transChange> afflicted with a skin disease.</verse>
    <verse num="2">When the Arameans went <transChange type="added">on</transChange> a raid, they brought back a young girl from the land of Israel, and {she came into the service of}<note>Literally "she became before"</note> the wife of Naaman.</verse>
    <verse num="3">She said to her mistress, "If only my lord would <transChange type="added">come</transChange> before the prophet who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Samaria; then {he would cure his skin disease}."<note>Literally "he would withdraw him from his skin disease"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">He came and told his master, saying, "Thus and so the girl who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> from the land of Israel said."</verse>
    <verse num="5">So the king of Aram said, "Go, I will send a letter to the king of Israel." He went and took {with him}<note>Literally "in his hand"</note> ten talents of silver, six thousand <transChange type="added">shekels of</transChange> gold, and ten sets of clothing. </verse>
    <verse num="6">So he brought the letter of the king to Israel, saying, "Now, when this letter comes to you, I have just sent Naaman my servant to you that you may cure him from his skin disease."</verse>
    <verse num="7">It happened that when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, "Am I God to cause death or to give life? This man <transChange type="added">is</transChange> sending a man to me to cure his disease. Indeed! But know and see that he seeks an opportunity against me." </verse>
    <verse num="8">It happened that as soon as Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, "Why did you tear your clothes? Please may he come to me, that he might know that there is a prophet in Israel."</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Naaman came with his horses and his chariots, and he stopped <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the doorway of the house of Elisha.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go, you must wash seven times in the Jordan, then your flesh shall return to you, and you shall be clean."</verse>
    <verse num="11">But Naaman became angry and he went and said, "Look, I said to myself, 'Surely he will come out, stand, call upon the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hands over the spot; then he would take away the skin disease.'</verse>
    <verse num="12">Are not the Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all of the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them that I may be clean?" Then he turned and left in anger.</verse>
    <verse num="13">But his servants came near and spoke to him and said, "My father, <transChange type="added">if</transChange> the prophet had spoken a difficult thing to you to do, would you not have done <transChange type="added">it</transChange>? <transChange type="added">Why not</transChange> even when he says to you, 'Wash and you shall be clean'?"</verse>
    <verse num="14">So he went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh returned as the flesh of a small boy, and he was clean. </verse>
    <verse num="15">When he returned to the man of God, he and all of his army, he came and stood before him and said, "Please now, I know that there is no God in all of the world except in Israel. So then, please take a gift from your servant."</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he said, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> before whom I stand, I surely will not take <transChange type="added">it</transChange>." <transChange type="added">Still</transChange> he urged him to take <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, but he refused.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Naaman said, "If not, then please let a load of soil on a pair of mules be given to your servants, for your servant will never again bring a burnt offering and sacrifice to other gods, <transChange type="added">but</transChange> only to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="18">As far as this matter, may Yahweh pardon your servant when my master goes <transChange type="added">into</transChange> the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> leaning himself on my arm, that I also bow down <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the house of Rimmon: when I bow down <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh please pardon your servant in this matter."</verse>
    <verse num="19">He said to him, "Go in peace," so he went from him {a short distance}.<note>Literally "a stretch of land"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="20">But Gehazi the servant of Elisha, the man of God, thought, "Look, my master has refrained from taking what this Aramean Naaman brought from his hand. {As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> I will certainly run after him, and I will accept something from him."</verse>
    <verse num="21">So Gehazi pursued after Naaman. When Naaman saw <transChange type="added">someone</transChange> running after him, he jumped off his chariot to meet him and asked him, "<transChange type="added">Is it</transChange> peace?"</verse>
    <verse num="22">He said, "Peace. My master has sent me saying, 'Look, {just now}<note>Literally "now this"</note> two servants from the hill country of Ephraim came to me, from the sons of the prophets. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.'"</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then Naaman said, "Be prepared to accept two talents." So he urged him and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing and gave it to two of his servants and they carried it before him.</verse>
    <verse num="24">When he came to the citadel, he took them from their hand and put them in the house, then sent away the men so that they went.</verse>
    <verse num="25">When he went and stood by his master, Elisha asked him, "From where have you come, Gehazi?" And he said, "Your servant has not gone {anywhere}."<note>Literally "where to where"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="26">Then he said to him, "Did not my heart go <transChange type="added">with you</transChange> as the man turned from on his chariot to meet you? <transChange type="added">Is</transChange> it time to take silver, clothes, olive orchards, vineyards, sheep, oxen, male slaves, and female slaves?</verse>
    <verse num="27">The skin disease of Naaman shall cling to you and to your offspring forever." Then he went out from before him having a skin disease like the snow. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Then the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "Please look; the place where we are living before you <transChange type="added">is</transChange> too cramped for us.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Let us please go to the Jordan and each bring from there one log that we might make a place there for us to live." Then he said, "Do so."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then a certain one said, "Please be prepared and go with your servants," and he said, "I will go."</verse>
    <verse num="4">He went with them, and they went to the Jordan, and they cut down the trees.</verse>
    <verse num="5">It happened as the one <transChange type="added">was</transChange> felling the log, that the iron ax fell into the water. He called out and said, "Oh, no! My master, it was borrowed!"</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the man of God said, "Where did it fall?" So he showed him the place, and then he cut off a stick and threw <transChange type="added">it</transChange> there and made the iron ax float.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then he said, "Pick <transChange type="added">it</transChange> up for yourself," so he stretched out his hand and took it. </verse>
    <verse num="8">The king of Aram was fighting with Israel, so he consulted with his officers, saying, "My camp is {at such and such a place}."<note>Literally "to a place a certain someone"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">Then the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, "Take care while crossing over to this place, because <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans <transChange type="added">are</transChange> descending there."</verse>
    <verse num="10">So the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God said to him and warned him, so he was on guard there {continually}.<note>Literally "not once or twice"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then the heart of the king of Aram was stormy because of this matter, so he called his servants and said to them, "Can you not tell me {who among us sides with the king of Israel}?"<note>Literally "who from of us to the king of Israel"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">Then one of his servants said, "No, my lord the king, but Elisha the prophet who is <transChange type="added">in</transChange> Israel tells the king of Israel things which you speak {in your own bedchamber}."<note>Literally "in the private room of your bed"</note></verse>
    <verse num="13">Then he said, "Go and see where he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> so that I can send and capture him." Then he was told to him, "Look, <transChange type="added">he is</transChange> in Dothan."</verse>
    <verse num="14">So he sent horses, chariots, and an oppressing army there. They arrived at night and surrounded the town.</verse>
    <verse num="15">The attendant of the man of God arose early and went out, and look, the army <transChange type="added">was</transChange> surrounding the city with horses and chariots. His servant said to him, "Oh no, my master! What shall we do?"</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he said, "Don't be afraid, for more <transChange type="added">are</transChange> with us than are with them."</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Elisha prayed and said, "O Yahweh, please open his eyes that he may see," and Yahweh opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw, and look, the mountain <transChange type="added">was</transChange> full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.</verse>
    <verse num="18">They came down to him, and Elisha prayed to Yahweh and said, "Please strike this people with blindness," so he struck them with blindness as {Elisha had spoken}.<note>Literally "according to the word of Elisha"</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">Then Elisha said to them, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not the way and this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not the city. Come after me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." Then he brought them to Samaria. </verse>
    <verse num="20">It happened at the moment they came to Samaria, Elisha said, "O Yahweh, open the eyes of these that they may see," so Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw, and look, the middle of Samaria!</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then the king of Israel said to Elisha when he saw them, "Shall I kill them? Shall I kill, my father?"</verse>
    <verse num="22">And he said, "You shall not kill. Would you kill <transChange type="added">those</transChange> whom you took captive with the sword or with the bow? Put food and water before them that they may eat and drink and then go to their master."</verse>
    <verse num="23">So he made a great feast for them, and they ate and drank; then he sent them, and they went to their master. And the bands of the Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="24">It happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Aram assembled all of his army and marched up and laid siege against Samaria.</verse>
    <verse num="25">There was a great famine in Samaria, and behold, a siege <transChange type="added">was</transChange> against it, until the head of a donkey <transChange type="added">went</transChange> for eighty shekels of silver, and one fourth of the measure of the dung of doves <transChange type="added">went</transChange> for five shekels of silver.</verse>
    <verse num="26">It happened that the king of Israel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> crossing over on the wall, and a woman called out to him, saying, "Help, my lord the king!"</verse>
    <verse num="27">He said, "No, let Yahweh help you. {How}<note>Literally "From where"</note> can I save you? From the threshing floor or from the wine press?"</verse>
    <verse num="28">The king said to her, "{What is the problem}?"<note>Literally "What is for you"</note> Then the woman said, "This woman said to me, 'Give me your son, and let us eat him today, then tomorrow we will eat my son.'</verse>
    <verse num="29">So we cooked my son and ate him, and I said to her the next day, 'Give your son that we may eat him.' But she had hidden her son."</verse>
    <verse num="30">It happened that when the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. Now he had been walking on the wall, and the people saw, and behold, sackcloth was over his flesh underneath.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then he said, "May God do to me and thus may he add, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!"</verse>
    <verse num="32">Now Elisha <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sitting in his house and the elders <transChange type="added">were</transChange> sitting with him, and <transChange type="added">the king</transChange> dispatched a man from before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, "Did you see that this son of a murderer has sent to remove my head? Look, when the messenger comes, close the door; and you must {hold the door closed against him}.<note>Literally "hold him close against the door"</note> <transChange type="added">Is</transChange> not the sound of the feet of his master behind him?"</verse>
    <verse num="33">While he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> still speaking with them, suddenly the messenger <transChange type="added">was</transChange> coming down to him, and he said, "Look this trouble <transChange type="added">is</transChange> from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?" </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">Elisha said, "Hear the word of Yahweh: 'Thus says Yahweh, "At this time tomorrow a seah of wheat bread flour <transChange type="added">will sell</transChange> for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.'"</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then the officer {on whom the king relied}<note>Literally "whom the king was leaning on his hand"</note> answered the man of God and said, "Look, <transChange type="added">even if</transChange> Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> making windows in heaven, could this thing happen?" And he said, "Look, you <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> seeing <transChange type="added">it</transChange> with your eyes, but you shall not eat from it there." </verse>
    <verse num="3">Now four men who had a skin disease were <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the entrance of the gate, and they said {to each other},<note>Literally "each to his friend"</note> "Why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> we sitting here until we die?</verse>
    <verse num="4">If we say, 'Let us go <transChange type="added">into</transChange> the city,' the famine <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the city, and we shall die there; but if we sit here, we shall die. So then, come, let us fall into the camp of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans. If they let us live, we shall live; but if they kill us, then we shall die."</verse>
    <verse num="5">So they got up at dusk to go to the camp of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans. They went up to the edge of the camp of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans, and look, there was no man there!</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now the Lord had caused the camp of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, the sound of horses, and the sound of a great army. So they said {to one another},<note>Literally "each to his brother"</note> "Look, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us!"</verse>
    <verse num="7">So they got up and fled at dusk and left their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and the camp as it was, and they fled for their lives.</verse>
    <verse num="8">When these who had the skin disease came to the edge of the camp, they went into a certain tent and they ate, drank, and took from there silver and gold and clothes. Then they went and hid <transChange type="added">them</transChange>, then returned and came to another tent, and they took from there and went and hid <transChange type="added">them</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Then they said {to one another},<note>Literally "each to his friend"</note> "We <transChange type="added">are</transChange> not doing right. This day is a day of good news! If we <transChange type="added">are</transChange> silent and wait until the light of morning, they will find us and {we will be punished}.<note>Literally "guiltiness"</note> So then, come, let us go and tell the house of the king."</verse>
    <verse num="10">When they came, they called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, saying, "We came to the camp of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans, and behold, there was no man or the voice of a man there! Only the horses and the donkeys were tied up, and the tents <transChange type="added">were left</transChange> as they <transChange type="added">were</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then the gatekeepers called and told <transChange type="added">it</transChange> inside the house of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="12">The king got up in the night and said to his servants, "Please let me tell you what <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans have done to us. <transChange type="added">The</transChange> Arameans know that we <transChange type="added">are</transChange> hungry, so they went out from the camp to hide in the field, saying, 'When they go out from the city, we shall seize them alive and go into the city.'"</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then one of his servants replied and said, "Please let them take five of the remaining horses which remain in <transChange type="added">the city</transChange>; behold, they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> like all of the multitude of Israel that remain in it; they are like all the multitude of Israel who have perished. Let us send and see."</verse>
    <verse num="14">So he took two charioteer horsemen, and the king sent after the camp of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans, saying, "Go, find out,"</verse>
    <verse num="15">and they went after them to the Jordan. Look, all of the way <transChange type="added">was</transChange> littered with clothes and equipment which <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans had thrown away in their haste. Then the messengers returned and told the king. </verse>
    <verse num="16">So the people went out and plundered the camp of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Arameans. A seah of wheat flour <transChange type="added">went</transChange> for a shekel and two seahs of barley <transChange type="added">went</transChange> for a shekel according to the word of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then the king appointed the officer he was depending on over the gate, but the people trampled him and he died, according to that which the man of God had said which he spoke when the king came down to him.</verse>
    <verse num="18">It happened as the man of God spoke to the king, saying, "Two seahs of barley <transChange type="added">shall be sold</transChange> for a shekel and a seah of wheat flour for a shekel at this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria."</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then the officer had replied to the man of God and said, "Look, even if Yahweh is opening the windows in heaven, could this thing happen?" And he had said, "Look you <transChange type="added">are about to</transChange> see it with your eyes, but you will not eat from it."</verse>
    <verse num="20">So it had happened to him; the people trampled him in the gate and he died. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, "Get up and go, you and your household, and dwell as an alien wherever you can, for Yahweh has called for a famine, and it will come to the land <transChange type="added">for</transChange> seven years."</verse>
    <verse num="2">So the woman got up and did according to the word of the man of God. She and her household went and dwelt as an alien in the land of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines for seven years.</verse>
    <verse num="3">It happened at the end of seven years that the woman returned from the land of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Philistines and went out to appeal to the king for her household and for her {properties}.<note>Literally "fields"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">Now the king <transChange type="added">was</transChange> speaking to Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, "Please tell me all of the great things which Elisha has done."</verse>
    <verse num="5">It happened that as he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, suddenly the woman whose son he had restored to life <transChange type="added">was</transChange> crying out to the king about her household and about her field. Then Gehazi said, "My lord the king, this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life!"</verse>
    <verse num="6">So the king asked the woman, and she told him. So the king appointed for her a certain court official, saying, "Restore all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> hers and all the yield of the field from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> day she left the land up to now." </verse>
    <verse num="7">Elisha came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Damascus. Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram <transChange type="added">was</transChange> ill, and he was told, "The man of God has come up here."</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then the king said to Hazael, "Take a gift in your hand and go meet the man of God. Inquire of Yahweh from him, saying, 'Shall I recover from this illness?'"</verse>
    <verse num="9">So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand of all of the good things of Damascus, a load <transChange type="added">on each</transChange> of forty camels, and he came and stood before him. Then he said, "Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, 'Shall I recover from this illness?'"</verse>
    <verse num="10">Elisha said to him, "Go; say to him, 'You shall certainly recover,' but Yahweh has shown me that he certainly will die."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then the man {fixed his gaze and stared at him}<note>Literally "caused his face to stand and set it"</note> until he was ashamed and the man of God cried.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Hazael asked, "Why <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my lord crying?" He said, "Because I know what evil you will do to the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> You will {set their fortifications on fire},<note>Literally "you will send their fortifications with the fire"</note> and you will kill their young men with the sword. Their little ones you will dash to pieces, and their pregnant women you will rip open!"</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Hazael said, "But how could your servant, who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like a dog, do this great thing?" Elisha said, "Yahweh has shown me <transChange type="added">that</transChange> you <transChange type="added">are to be</transChange> king over Aram."</verse>
    <verse num="14">So he departed from Elisha and came to his master. He asked him, "What did Elisha say to you." So he said, "He said to me that you will certainly recover."</verse>
    <verse num="15">On the next day, he took the bed cover, dipped <transChange type="added">it</transChange> in the water, and spread <transChange type="added">it</transChange> over his face so that he died. Then Hazael became king in his place. </verse>
    <verse num="16">Now in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Joram son of Jehoshaphat became the king of Judah.<note>This likely indicates a coregency in Judah at the time.</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="18">He walked in the way of the kings of Israel as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab became his wife, and he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Yet Yahweh was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, as he had promised to give him a lamp for his sons always. </verse>
    <verse num="20">In his days, Edom rebelled {against the rule}<note>Literally "from under the hand"</note> of Judah, and they set up a king over them.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So Joram crossed over to Zair and all the chariots with him. It happened that he arose <transChange type="added">by</transChange> night and attacked Edom who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots; but the army fled to their tents.</verse>
    <verse num="22">So Edom has rebelled {against the rule}<note>Literally "from under the hand"</note> of Judah until this day; then Libnah <transChange type="added">also</transChange> rebelled at that time.</verse>
    <verse num="23">The remainder of the acts of Joram and all that he did, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah?</verse>
    <verse num="24">So Joram slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and he was buried with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> in the city of David, and Ahaziah his son became king in place of him. </verse>
    <verse num="25">In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Joram became king of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Ahaziah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Athaliah daughter of Omri, king of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="27">He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, as the house of Ahab; for he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the son-in-law of the house of Ahab. </verse>
    <verse num="28">He went with Joram the son of Ahab for the battle against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-Gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Joram the king returned to Jezreel to heal from the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted at Ramah when Hazael king of Aram fought him.

  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">Now Elisha the prophet called for one of the sons of the prophets, and he said to him, "Gird your loins, and take this flask of olive oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead.</verse>

    <verse num="3">You must take the flask of olive oil and pour it out on his head. You must say, 'Thus says Yahweh, "I hereby anoint you as king over Israel." ' Then you must open the door and flee; do not linger!" </verse>
    <verse num="4">So the young man, servant of the prophet, went <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Ramoth-Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He came, and look, the commanders of the army <transChange type="added">were</transChange> sitting <transChange type="added">there</transChange>. He said, "I have a word for you, O commander!" Jehu said, "For whom? For all of us?" And he said, "For you, O commander!"</verse>
    <verse num="6">He got up and went to the house, and poured the olive oil on his head and said to him, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: 'I hereby anoint you as king over the people of Yahweh, over Israel.</verse>

    <verse num="13">So they hastened each one to take his cloak, and they spread <transChange type="added">them</transChange> under him on the bare steps, blew on the trumpet, and said, "Jehu is king!" </verse>
    <verse num="14">So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram was keeping guard in Ramoth-Gilead, he and all of Israel, because of the {threat}<note>Literally "from the face/presence of"</note> of Hazael king of Aram.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But Joram the king had returned to heal in Jezreel from the wound which the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram.

Then the watchman reported, saying, "The messenger went up to them, but he did not return."</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then he sent out a second horseman, and he came to them and said, "Thus the king asks, 'Is it peace?'" Then Jehu said, "{What do you have to do with peace}?<note>Literally "What is for you and for peace"</note> Turn after me."</verse>
    <verse num="20">So the sentinel reported, saying, "He went up to them, but he did not return, and the driving <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives with madness." </verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Joram said, "Get ready," so he got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel went out, and Ahaziah king of Judah, each with his chariot. They went out to meet Jehu, and they found him at the tract of land of Naboth the Jezreelite.</verse>
    <verse num="22">When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, "<transChange type="added">Is it</transChange> peace?" And he said, "What peace <transChange type="added">is there</transChange> while the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her sorceries are numerous?"</verse>
    <verse num="23">Joram turned his {chariot}<note>Literally "hand"</note> and fled and said to Ahaziah, "It's treason, Ahaziah!"</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then Jehu {drew his bow}<note>Literally "filled his hand with the bow"</note> and shot Joram between his shoulders so that the arrow went out from his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot.</verse>
    <verse num="25">He said to Bidkar his third <transChange type="added">servant</transChange>, "Lift <transChange type="added">him</transChange> out and throw him on the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, for remember, you and I <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with the pair <transChange type="added">of chariots</transChange> behind Ahab his father when Yahweh pronounced this oracle against him:</verse>
    <verse num="26">'"Since I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his children yesterday," declares Yahweh, "I will requite it for you in this tract of land," declares Yahweh.' So then lift him out and throw him on the tract of land according to the word of Yahweh." </verse>
    <verse num="27">When Ahaziah king of Judah saw, he fled the way of Beth-Haggen. Jehu pursued after him and said, "Shoot him also, in the chariot." <transChange type="added">They shot him</transChange> at the ascent of Gur which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Ibleam, and he fled <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Megiddo, but he died there.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then his officers carried him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his tomb with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> in the city of David.</verse>
    <verse num="29">In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah. </verse>
    <verse num="30">When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard <transChange type="added">of it</transChange>, so she painted her eyes with black eye paint and adorned her head and looked through the window.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Now Jehu had come in the gate, so she said, "<transChange type="added">Is it</transChange> peace, O Zimri, murderer of his master?"</verse>
    <verse num="32">When he lifted up his face to the window, he asked, "Who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with me?" Two or three eunuchs looked down to him.</verse>
    <verse num="33">So he said, "Throw her down." So they threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled her.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Then he came and ate and drank, and said, "Please take care of this cursed one and bury her, for she is the daughter of a king."</verse>
    <verse num="35">When they went to bury her, they could not find her, except the skull, the feet, and the palms of the hands.</verse>
    <verse num="36">They returned and told him, and he said, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'On the plot of ground of Jezreel, the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel.'"</verse>
    <verse num="37">So the dead body of Jezebel became dung on the surface <transChange type="added">spread</transChange> on the field in the plot of ground of Jezreel, so one cannot say, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Jezebel." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria, and Jehu wrote letters, and he sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">"Now, when this letter comes to you and your master's sons <transChange type="added">are</transChange> with you, the chariots <transChange type="added">are</transChange> with you, the horses, a fortified city, and weapons,</verse>
    <verse num="3">then you must select the best and the most suitable from the sons of your master, and you must place <transChange type="added">him</transChange> on the throne of his father, and they must fight for the house of your masters."</verse>
    <verse num="4">But they were very afraid, and they said, "Look, two kings could not stand before him; how can we stand?"</verse>
    <verse num="5">So whoever was over the house, and whoever was over the city, and the elders and the guardians sent to Jehu, saying, "We <transChange type="added">are</transChange> your servants; all that you say to us, we shall do. We shall not make anyone a king. Do <transChange type="added">what</transChange> is good in your eyes." </verse>
    <verse num="6">Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, "If you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> for me, and you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> listening to my voice, take the heads of the men of the sons of your master and come to me at <transChange type="added">this</transChange> time tomorrow at Jezreel." Now the sons of the king, seventy men, <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with the leaders of the city who were raising them.</verse>
    <verse num="7">When the letter came to them, they took the sons of the king, and they killed seventy men. Then they put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then the messenger came and told him, saying, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons," and he said, "Put them <transChange type="added">in</transChange> two piles <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the entrance of the gate until morning."</verse>
    <verse num="9">It happened in the morning that he went out, stood, and said to all of the people, "You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> righteous. Look, I conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all of these?</verse>
    <verse num="10">Know then that {the word of Yahweh will not fail}<note>Literally "it shall not fall from the word of Yahweh to the ground"</note> which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab; Yahweh has done what he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Jehu killed all of the remainder of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all of his leaders, his close friends, and his priests, until there was no survivor left for him. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Then he arose and went and came to Samaria. On the way, he was <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Beth-Eked of the shepherds,</verse>
    <verse num="13">and Jehu met the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah. He asked, "Who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you?" They said, "We <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the brothers of Ahaziah; we came down for the peace of the king's children and the children of the queen."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then he said, "Seize them alive!" So they seized them alive but then slaughtered them at the cistern of Beth-Eked, forty-two men. He did not allow any of them to survive. </verse>
    <verse num="15">Next he went from there and found Jehonadab the son of Recab to meet him. He greeted him and asked him, "{Is your heart right with me as my heart is with you}?"<note>Literally "Is there uprightness with your heart as that of my heart with your heart"</note> Then Jehonadab said, "Yes, it is. Give your hand!" And he gave his hand and took him up to him on the chariot.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then he said, "Come with me! Look at my zeal for Yahweh!" So he let him ride in his chariot.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then he came to Samaria and killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria until he wiped them out according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken to Elijah. </verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Jehu assembled all of the people and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will worship him greatly.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So then, summon to me all of the prophets of Baal and all of his servants and his priests; no man should fail to come, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come shall not live!" Now Jehu was acting with cunning in order to destroy the servants of Baal.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Jehu said, "Sanctify a <transChange type="added">solemn</transChange> assembly for Baal!" So they proclaimed <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Jehu sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> through all of Israel, and all of the servants of Baal came; there did not remain a man who did not come. They came to the house of Baal so that the house of Baal was filled from {wall to wall}.<note>Literally "edge to edge"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">He said to the one who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the wardrobe, "Bring out clothing for all of the servants of Baal." So he brought the clothing out for them.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Recab came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the temple of Baal, and he said to the servants of Baal, "Search and see that there is none of the servants of Yahweh here with you; only those who serve Baal."</verse>
    <verse num="24">They came to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed for himself eighty men outside, and he said, "The man who lets <transChange type="added">anyone</transChange> escape from the men who I am {entrusting to you},<note>Literally "bringing upon your hand"</note> {he will pay with his life}!"<note>Literally "his life in place of his life"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="25">It happened that when he finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the royal guard and to the officers, "Come and kill them; let no man go free!" So {they put them to the sword},<note>Literally "they struck them with the edge of the sword"</note> and the royal guard and the officers threw them out, then they went up to the citadel of the temple of Baal.</verse>
    <verse num="26">They brought out the stone pillars of the temple of Baal and burned {them}.<note>Literally "it"</note></verse>
    <verse num="27">So they broke down the stone pillars of Baal and destroyed the temple of Baal and made it into a latrine until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="28">So Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="29">Only Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat <transChange type="added">by</transChange> which he caused Israel to sin; <transChange type="added">namely,</transChange> the calf-shaped idols of gold which <transChange type="added">were in</transChange> Bethel and Dan.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Yahweh said to Jehu, "Because you have done well by doing right in my eyes and you have done to the house of Ahab according to all that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in my heart; <transChange type="added">therefore,</transChange> sons of the fourth generation will sit for you on the throne of Israel."</verse>
    <verse num="31">But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of Yahweh God of Israel with all his heart; he did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam <transChange type="added">by</transChange> which he caused Israel to sin. </verse>
    <verse num="32">In those days, Yahweh began to reduce Israel, so Hazael defeated them in every territory of Israel,</verse>
    <verse num="33">from the Jordan eastward: all of the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on the Wadi Arnon and Gilead and Bashan.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Now the remainder of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all of his powerful <transChange type="added">deeds, are</transChange> they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel?</verse>
    <verse num="35">So Jehu slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and they buried him in Samaria, and Jehoahaz his son became king in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Now the days which Jehu had reigned over Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> twenty-eight years in Samaria. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">Now Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, so she prepared to destroy all of the offspring of the royal family.</verse>
    <verse num="2">But Jehosheba the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah took Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, and she stole him from among the sons of the king who were being put to death, <transChange type="added">putting</transChange> him and his nurse in the inner bedroom. So they hid him from the presence of Athaliah, and he was not killed.</verse>
    <verse num="3">He remained with her in the temple of Yahweh, hidden for six years <transChange type="added">while</transChange> Athaliah was reigning over the land. </verse>
    <verse num="4">But in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took the commanders of the hundreds of the Carites and the runners, and he brought them to himself to the temple of Yahweh. Then he {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant with them and made them swear in the house of Yahweh and showed them the son of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He commanded them, saying, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the thing which you must do: one third of you {who go off duty on the Sabbath},<note>Literally "who go on the Sabbath"</note> the keepers of the guard in the house of the king,</verse>
    <verse num="6">and another third at the gate of Sur, and a third at the gate behind the runners, shall guard the post of the palace alternately.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Two of the units among you, all {who go on duty on the Sabbath},<note>Literally "the going out of the Sabbath"</note> guard the post of the temple of Yahweh for the king.</verse>
    <verse num="8">You must surround the king all about, each with his weapon in his hand; whoever comes to the ranks must be killed. Be with the king {wherever he goes}."<note>Literally "when he goes out and when he comes"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="9">So the commanders of hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and each took his men {who went off duty on the Sabbath}<note>Literally "the coming of the Sabbath"</note> and those {who came on duty on the Sabbath},<note>Literally "the going out of the Sabbath"</note> and they came to Jehoiada the priest.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the priest gave to the commanders of the hundreds spears and small round shields which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> King David's, which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So the royal runners stood, each <transChange type="added">with</transChange> his weapons in his hand, from the side of the temple to the south up to the side of the temple on the north, around the altar and around the temple, about the king all around.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then he brought out the son of the king, put the crown on him with the testimony, and they made him king, anointed him, clapped <transChange type="added">their</transChange> hands, and said, "<transChange type="added">Long</transChange> live the king!" </verse>
    <verse num="13">When Athaliah heard the sound of the runners of the people, she came to the people at the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="14">She looked, and there was the king standing by the pillar according to the custom. The commanders and the trumpeters <transChange type="added">were</transChange> by the king, and all of the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing on the trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and she called, "Treason, treason!"</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the commanders of the hundreds, the appointed of the army, and he said to them, "Bring her out to the house of the ranks! The one coming after her <transChange type="added">should</transChange> kill her with the sword," for the priest had said, "Let her not be killed in the temple of Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="16">So {they grabbed her}<note>Literally "they put hands to her"</note> as she went <transChange type="added">by</transChange> the entranceway of the horses to the palace of the king, and she was killed there.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Jehoiada {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that the people should be as a people for Yahweh, and <transChange type="added">also a covenant</transChange> between the king and the people.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down, and its altars and its images they broke completely into pieces. Mattan the priest of Baal they killed in front of the altars. Then the priest put guards over the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="19">He took the commanders of the hundreds and the Carites and the runners and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the temple of Yahweh. And they marched by the way of the runner's gate <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the palace of the king, and he sat on the throne of the kings.</verse>
    <verse num="20">All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city rested; <transChange type="added">for</transChange> Athaliah had been killed with the sword in the palace of the king. </verse>
    <verse num="21"><note>2 Kings 11:21-12:21 in the English Bible is 2 Kings 12:1-22 in the Hebrew Bible</note> Jehoash <transChange type="added">was</transChange> {seven years old}<note>Literally "a son of seven years"</note> when he began to reign. </verse>

  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king. He reigned in Jerusalem forty years, and the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Zibiah from Beersheba.</verse>

    <verse num="3">Only the high places were not removed; the people <transChange type="added">were</transChange> still making sacrifices and offering incense on the high places. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Jehoash said to the priests, "All of the money for the sacred things that is brought to the temple of Yahweh, {the money taxed at its proper value for each person}<note>Literally "money passing over a man, the money of persons his proper value"</note> <transChange type="added">and</transChange> all of the money which comes upon the heart of a man to bring to the temple of Yahweh,</verse>

    <verse num="6">It happened in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash that the priests had not repaired the damage in the temple.</verse>

    <verse num="9">Then Jehoiada the priest took a certain chest and bored a hole in its lid, and he put it beside the altar to the right as a man enters into the temple of Yahweh; then the priests who were keepers of the threshold would put there all of the money brought into the temple.</verse>
    <verse num="10">It happened that when they saw a great deal of money in the chest, the secretary of the king and the high priest would come up, put the money in bags, then count the money found in the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="11">They placed the money, <transChange type="added">which was</transChange> weighed out, into the hands of the workers who were appointed over the temple of Yahweh, and they paid <transChange type="added">it to</transChange> the skilled craftsmen of wood and <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the builders working on the temple of Yahweh</verse>
    <verse num="12">and to the masons and the stonecutters, to buy timber and stones for hewing, in order to repair the damage of the temple of Yahweh, and for all who went to the temple to repair it.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Only, for the temple of Yahweh, there were not any silver basins, snuffers, bowls for drinking wine, trumpets, or any vessel of gold or silver from the money being brought <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For they gave that to all the workers, and they repaired the temple<note>Or "house"</note> of Yahweh with it.</verse>
    <verse num="15">They did not <transChange type="added">have to</transChange> settle accounts with the men into whose hands they placed the money to give to the workers, for they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> dealing honestly.</verse>

    <verse num="24">When Hazael king of Aram died, his son Ben-Hadad became king in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz returned and took the cities from the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael which he had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz his father in the war. Three times Jehoash defeated him and recovered the towns of Israel. </verse>

    <verse num="1">In the second year of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Jehoash king of Judah began to reign.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Jehoaddin from Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="3">He did right in the eyes of Yahweh, only not as David his ancestor;<note>Or "father"</note> as all which Jehoash his father had done, he did.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Only the high places were not removed; the people <transChange type="added">were</transChange> still sacrificing and offering incense on the high places. </verse>
    <verse num="5">It happened that when the kingdom was firmly in his hand, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But the sons of the killers he did not kill, as it is written in the scroll of the law of Moses which Yahweh had commanded, saying, "Fathers should not be killed because of children, and children should not be killed because of fathers; but a man should die because of his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> sin."</verse>
    <verse num="7">He also killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and he seized Sela in the battle, and he called its name Jokteel, until this day. </verse>

    <verse num="9">So Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah, saying, "The thornbush which is in Lebanon sent to the cedar which is in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as wife,' but an animal of the field which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thornbush.</verse>
    <verse num="10">You have indeed defeated Edom and your heart is lifted up; enjoy the honor and stay home. Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall and Judah with you?" </verse>
    <verse num="11">But Amaziah would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel went up and they met face-to-face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-Shemesh which belongs to Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Judah was defeated before Israel and they fled, each to this tent.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-Shemesh.

  <chapter num="17">
    <verse num="1">In the twelfth year of Ahaz the king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, <transChange type="added">reigning</transChange> nine years.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Shalmaneser the king of Assyria<note>This would have been Shalmaneser V of Assyria (ruled ca. 727-722 bc)</note> came up against him, and Hoshea became his vassal and paid tribute to him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and he did not offer tribute to the king of Assyria as <transChange type="added">he had</transChange> year after year; so the king of Assyria arrested him, and confined him <transChange type="added">in</transChange> a house of imprisonment.</verse>
    <verse num="5">So the king of Assyria went up in all the land, then he went up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Samaria and besieged it <transChange type="added">for</transChange> three years. </verse>
    <verse num="6">In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported Israel to Assyria. He placed them in Halah, in Habor, <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the river <transChange type="added">regions</transChange> of Gozan, and <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the cities of the Medes.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Now <transChange type="added">this</transChange> happened because the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> had sinned against Yahweh their God when he brought them up from the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh the king of Egypt and they feared other gods.</verse>
    <verse num="8">They walked in the statutes of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out from before the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> which the kings of Israel had introduced.</verse>
    <verse num="9">The {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> secretly did things which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not right, against Yahweh their God; they built high places for themselves in all their towns, from the watchtower up to the fortified city.</verse>
    <verse num="10">They set up for themselves stone pillars and poles of Asherah worship on every high hill and under every green tree.</verse>
    <verse num="11">They burned incense there on all the high places, like the nations which Yahweh deported before them, and they did evil things to provoke Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="12">They served idols which Yahweh had said to them, "You shall not do this thing!"</verse>
    <verse num="13">Yahweh warned Israel and Judah by the hand of his every prophet, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> every seer saying, "Turn from all of your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my ordinances, according to all the law which I commanded your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> which I sent to you by the hand of my servants the prophets."</verse>
    <verse num="14">But they did not listen and they stiffened their necks, like the necks of their ancestors<note>Or "fathers</note> who did not believe in Yahweh their God.</verse>
    <verse num="15">They rejected his statutes, his covenant which he {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> with their ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and his warnings which he gave to them; and they went after the idols, became vain, and <transChange type="added">went</transChange> after all the nations which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> all around them, which Yahweh had commanded them not to do as they <transChange type="added">did</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="16">They abandoned all the commands of Yahweh their God and made for themselves two molten calf-shaped idols; they made a pole of Asherah worship and bowed down to the army of the heavens and served Baal.</verse>
    <verse num="17">They made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, they practiced divination and read omens, and they sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of Yahweh to provoke him.</verse>
    <verse num="18">So Yahweh was very angry with Israel and he removed them from his presence; none remained except the tribe of Judah alone. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Even Judah did not keep the commands of Yahweh their God, and they walked in the customs of Israel which they introduced,</verse>
    <verse num="20">so Yahweh rejected all the offspring of Israel and punished them, and he gave them into the hand of the plunderers until he banished them from his presence.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For he had torn Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king, but Jeroboam detached Israel from following Yahweh, and he made them sin a great sin.</verse>
    <verse num="22">The {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he committed, and they did not depart from it,</verse>
    <verse num="23">until Yahweh removed Israel from his presence as he had foretold by the hand of all his servants, the prophets. And so he deported Israel from upon his land to Assyria until this day. </verse>
    <verse num="24">The king of Assyria brought from Babylonia, from Cush, from Arva, from Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and he settled <transChange type="added">them</transChange> in the cities of Samaria in place of the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> so they took possession of Samaria and lived in her cities.</verse>
    <verse num="25">It happened that when they began living there, they did not fear Yahweh, so Yahweh sent lions among them, and they were killing them.<note>Leviticus 26:22 warns that non-belief will result in attacks from wild animals.</note></verse>
    <verse num="26">So they said to the king of Assyria, "The nations whom you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the customs of the God of the land, so he sent lions among them, and now they are killing them because they do not know the customs of the God of the land."</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, "Release one of the priests whom you deported from there, and let him go and settle there. Let him teach them the customs of the God of the land."</verse>
    <verse num="28">So one of the priests went, whom they had deported from Samaria, and he settled in Bethel and was teaching them how they should fear Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="29">Yet every nation was making their<note>Hebrew "his"</note> gods, and they put them in the shrine of the high places that the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> living.</verse>
    <verse num="30">The men of Babylonia made Succoth Benoth; the men of Cush made Nergal; the men of Hamath made Ashima.</verse>
    <verse num="31">The Arvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; the Sepharvites were burning their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Those who were fearing Yahweh made priests of the high places {from among themselves},<note>Literally "for them from their ends"</note> and they were sacrificing for them in the shrines of the high places.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Yahweh they were fearing, but their gods they were serving, according to the customs of the nations from which they were deported. </verse>
    <verse num="34">Until this day they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> doing according to their former customs; none of them <transChange type="added">are</transChange> fearing Yahweh, and none of them <transChange type="added">are</transChange> doing according to their statutes, to their decisions, to the law, or to the commands that Yahweh commanded the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Jacob <transChange type="added">to</transChange> which he had given the name Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Yahweh had {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant with them and commanded them, "You shall not fear other gods, nor shall you bow down to them, nor shall you serve them, nor shall you sacrifice to them.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Rather, Yahweh, who brought you out from the land of Egypt with great strength and with an outstretched arm--him you shall fear, and to him you shall bow down, and to him you shall sacrifice.</verse>
    <verse num="37">The statutes, the decisions, the law, and the commands that he wrote to you, you shall observe to do always, and you shall not fear other gods.</verse>
    <verse num="38">The covenant that I have {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> with you, you shall not forget, and you shall not fear other gods.</verse>
    <verse num="39">But Yahweh your God you shall fear, and he will deliver you from the hand of all of your enemies."</verse>
    <verse num="40">They did not listen but kept on doing according to their former customs.</verse>
    <verse num="41">So these nations were fearing Yahweh, but they were serving their idols, as were their children and their children's children; as their ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> did, they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> doing until this day. </verse>

    <verse num="9">It happened in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, that <transChange type="added">is,</transChange> the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came against Samaria and laid siege against her.</verse>
    <verse num="10">At the end of three years, he captured it in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that <transChange type="added">is,</transChange> the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel; Samaria was captured.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then the king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Habor, <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the river <transChange type="added">regions</transChange> of Gozan, and <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the cities of the Medes,</verse>
    <verse num="12">because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh their God, and they transgressed his covenant; all that he had commanded Moses, the servant of Yahweh, they did not listen <transChange type="added">to</transChange> nor did they obey. </verse>
    <verse num="13">In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">So Hezekiah king of Judah sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, "I have done wrong. Withdraw from me. What you impose on me I will bear." So the king of Assyria imposed on Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Hezekiah gave all of the silver found <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the temple of Yahweh and in the storerooms of the house of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="16">At that time, Hezekiah cut off the doors of the temple of Yahweh and the doorposts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and he gave them to the king of Assyria.</verse>
    <verse num="17">So the king of Assyria sent the commander in chief, the chief eunuch, and the {chief advisor}<note>Traditionally "Rabshekah"</note> from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a heavy army. They went up and came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem, then they went up and came and stood at the aqueduct of the upper pool which is on the main road of the {washer's}<note>Or "fuller's"</note> field.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then they called to the king, so Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to them. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Then the chief advisor said to them, "Please say to Hezekiah: 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this confidence that you trust?</verse>
    <verse num="20">You think only a word of lips, '<transChange type="added">I have</transChange> advice and power for the war.' Now, on whom do you trust that you have rebelled against me?</verse>
    <verse num="21">Now, look! You {rely}<note>Literally "trust for yourself"</note> on the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which <transChange type="added">when</transChange> a man leans on it, it goes into his hand and pierces it! So <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Pharaoh the king of Egypt for all who are trusting on him!</verse>
    <verse num="22">But if you say to me, 'On Yahweh our God we trust,' <transChange type="added">is</transChange> it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, and he had said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'In the presence of this altar you shall bow down <transChange type="added">only</transChange> in Jerusalem?'</verse>
    <verse num="23">So then, please make a wager with my lord, with the king of Assyria, and I will give to you a thousand horses {if you are able on your part to put riders on them.}<note>Literally "if you are able to give for yourself riders upon them"</note></verse>
    <verse num="24">How {can you repulse a single captain among the least of the servants of my master}<note>Literally "can you return the face of the governor one of the servants of my master"</note>? <transChange type="added">Yet</transChange> you rely for yourself on Egypt for chariots and horsemen!</verse>
    <verse num="25">Have I now come up against this place without Yahweh to destroy it? Yahweh has said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it!'" '" </verse>
    <verse num="26">Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah and Shebna and Joah said to the chief commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we <transChange type="added">are</transChange> understanding, but you must not speak Judean with us in the ears of the people who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> on the wall."</verse>
    <verse num="27">The chief commander said to them, "Is it <transChange type="added">solely</transChange> to your master and to you my master has sent me to speak these words? <transChange type="added">Is</transChange> it not for the men who sit on the wall to eat their feces and to drink their urine with you?" </verse>
    <verse num="28">Then the chief commander stood and called with a great voice in Judean, and he spoke and said, "Hear the word of the king, the great king of Assyria!</verse>
    <verse num="29">Thus says the king, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to rescue you from my<note>Hebrew "his"</note> hand.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Do not let Hezekiah <transChange type="added">make you</transChange> trust in Yahweh, saying, "Certainly Yahweh will rescue us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!" '</verse>
    <verse num="31">Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria, 'Make with me a treaty of peace and come out to me that each <transChange type="added">may</transChange> eat <transChange type="added">from</transChange> his vine and each <transChange type="added">from</transChange> his fig tree, and each <transChange type="added">may</transChange> drink water <transChange type="added">from</transChange> his cistern!</verse>
    <verse num="32">Until I come and take you to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees, olive oil, and honey, that <transChange type="added">you may</transChange> live and not die! You must not listen to Hezekiah, for he has misled you <transChange type="added">by</transChange> saying, "Yahweh will deliver us!"</verse>
    <verse num="33">Did the gods of each of the nations ever rescue the land from the hand of the king of Assyria?</verse>
    <verse num="34">Where <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? For did they rescue Samaria from my hand?</verse>
    <verse num="35">Who among all of the gods of the countries have rescued their countries from my hand that Yahweh should rescue Jerusalem from my hand?'" </verse>
    <verse num="36">The people were silent, and they did not answer him a word, for the command of that king was saying, "You shall not answer him."</verse>
    <verse num="37">Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah <transChange type="added">with</transChange> torn clothes, and they told him the words of the chief commander. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">It happened that when King Hezekiah heard, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He sent Eliakim who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the palace, Shebna the secretary, the elders, and the priests, <transChange type="added">all</transChange> clothed in sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</verse>
    <verse num="3">They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'A day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace is this day, for the children {are about to be born},<note>Literally "came up to the outer vagina"</note> but there is no strength to bear them.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Perhaps Yahweh your God will hear all of the words of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> chief commander whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to insult <transChange type="added">the</transChange> living God, and he will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remainder who are left.'"</verse>
    <verse num="5">So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,</verse>
    <verse num="6">and Isaiah said to them, "Thus you must say to your master, 'Thus says Yahweh, "You must not be afraid because the face of the words which you have heard, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled me.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Look, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> putting in him a spirit. He will hear a rumor and return to his land. Then I will cause him to fall by the sword in his land." '" </verse>
    <verse num="8">When <transChange type="added">the</transChange> chief commander returned, he found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He heard about Tirhakah, the king of Cush, saying, "Look, he has set out to fight with you," so he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="10">"Thus you shall say to Hezekiah the king of Judah, 'Let not your God whom you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> trusting deceive you, by his saying, "Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!"</verse>
    <verse num="11">Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, by utterly destroying them, and shall you be delivered?</verse>
    <verse num="12">Did the gods of the nations that my {predecessors}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> destroyed deliver them? <transChange type="added">Not</transChange> Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, <transChange type="added">nor</transChange> the children of Eden who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in Tel Assar.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Where are the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?'" </verse>
    <verse num="14">Hezekiah took the letters from the hand of the messengers and read them. <transChange type="added">Then</transChange> he went up to the temple of Yahweh, and Hezekiah spread them out before the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Hezekiah prayed before the face of Yahweh and said, "O Yahweh, God of Israel who lives <transChange type="added">above</transChange> the cherubim. You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the world; you have made the heavens and the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Incline your ears and hear; open, O Yahweh, your eyes and see and hear the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to insult the living God.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Truly, O Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have utterly destroyed the nations and their land.</verse>
    <verse num="18">He has hurled their gods in the fire because they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> not gods, but the work of the hands of a human <transChange type="added">made of</transChange> wood and stone, so they destroyed them.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So then, O Yahweh our God, rescue us, please, from his hand, that all of the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Yahweh, you alone are God!" </verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, 'What you have prayed to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.</verse>
    <verse num="21">This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: </verse>
    <verse num="22">Whom have you mocked and reviled? And against whom have you have raised <transChange type="added">your</transChange> voice and have haughtily lifted your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!</verse>
    <verse num="23">By the hand of your messengers you have mocked the Lord, and you have said, 'With my many chariots I have gone up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the height of the mountains. <transChange type="added">To</transChange> the remote areas of Lebanon, I have felled the tallest of its cedars, the choicest of its cypresses.

    <verse num="24">I dug <transChange type="added">wells</transChange> and I drank foreign water, and I dried up with the sole of my steps all the canals of Egypt.'</verse>
    <verse num="25">Have you not heard? From long ago I have determined it, from the days of old I have planned it, and now I am bringing it to pass. It shall be turned into a pile of rocks; fortified cities are ruined.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Their inhabitants, short of hand, shall be dismayed; and they shall be ashamed. They have become green plants of the open field, and tender grass, green grass of the roof and blight before the standing grain.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Your sitting, your going out, and your coming <transChange type="added">in</transChange> I know, and your raging against me.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Because you are raging against me, and your arrogance has come up in my ears, I will put my nose ring in your nose and my bridle in your mouth. And I will turn you back on the way that you have come.</verse>
    <verse num="29">" 'This will be the sign for you: Eat the volunteer plants for the year, and in the second year, the volunteer plants that spring up from that. But <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the third year, sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</verse>
    <verse num="30">The remainder of the house of Judah which survives will again <transChange type="added">take</transChange> root below and bear fruit above.</verse>
    <verse num="31">For from Jerusalem a remnant shall go out and survivors from Mount Zion; the zeal of Yahweh will do this. </verse>
    <verse num="32">" 'Therefore thus says Yahweh to the king of Assyria, "He shall not come to this city, nor shall he shoot an arrow there, nor shall he bring a small shield near her, nor shall he cast a siege ramp against her.</verse>
    <verse num="33">By the way that he came to her he shall return; but to this city, he shall not come," declares Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And I will defend this city to save her for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.'" </verse>
    <verse num="35">It happened in that night that an angel of Yahweh went out, and he struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Assyria. When they got up early in the morning, look! All of them <transChange type="added">were</transChange> dead corpses.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then Sennacherib king of Assyria set out and went and returned and lived in Nineveh.</verse>
    <verse num="37">It happened that he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer<note>So Kethib; Qere adds "his sons"</note> struck him with the sword. Then they escaped <transChange type="added">into</transChange> the land of Ararat, and Esarhaddon his son became king in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">In those days Hezekiah became {deathly ill},<note>Literally "ill to die"</note> and Isaiah the son of Amoz the prophet came to him and said to him, "Thus says Yahweh, 'Command your house, for you <transChange type="added">are about</transChange> to die; you will not recover.'"</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="3">"O Yahweh, please remember how I went about before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and <transChange type="added">remember</transChange> the good that I have done in your eyes." Then Hezekiah {wept bitterly}.<note>Literally "wept a great weeping"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">Isaiah had not gone out from the middle of the city when the word of Yahweh came to him, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="5">"Return; you must say to Hezekiah, the leader of my people, 'Thus says Yahweh the God of David your ancestor,<note>Or "father"</note> "I have heard your prayer and I have seen your tears. Look, I <transChange type="added">am about to</transChange> heal you. On the third day you shall go up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="6">I will add to your days fifteen years, and from the hand of the king of Assyria I will deliver you and this city. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of David my servant." '"</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Isaiah said, "Bring a lump of figs," so they took and put it on the skin sores, and he lived. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "What is the sign that Yahweh will heal me that I shall go up on the third day <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the temple of Yahweh?"</verse>
    <verse num="9">Isaiah said, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the sign for you from Yahweh that Yahweh will do the thing that he has promised: Shall the shadow advance ten steps or shall it return ten steps?"</verse>
    <verse num="10">Hezekiah answered, "It is easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps. No, but let the shadow return backwards ten steps."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Isaiah the prophet called to Yahweh, and he brought back the shadow on the steps where it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz, backwards ten steps. </verse>
    <verse num="12">At that time, Berodak-Baladan the son of Baladan king of {Babylon}<note>Or "Babel." Babel was the ancient name for Babylon, the capital of Babylonia. See also Genesis 11:9</note> sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been ill.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Hezekiah heard about them and showed them all of the house of his treasure, both the silver and the gold, the spices, the good olive oil, the room of his weapons, and all that could be found in his treasuries. There was nothing that he did not show them in his palace and in all of his kingdom.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, "What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?" Hezekiah said, "From a far land; they have come from Babylon."</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then he asked, "What did they see in your palace?" And Hezekiah said, "All that is in my palace they have seen; there is nothing that I did not show them in my treasuries." </verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of Yahweh!</verse>
    <verse num="17">'Look, days <transChange type="added">are</transChange> coming when all that is in your palace will be carried off; <transChange type="added">even</transChange> all that your ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> have stored up until this day, to Babylon; nothing shall be left,' says Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="18">'Your sons who went out from you, whom you brought forth, will be taken, and they shall be eunuchs in the temple of the king of Babylon.'"</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of Yahweh which you have spoken <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good," and he thought, "Is it not that peace and security shall be in my days?"</verse>
    <verse num="20">Now the remainder of the acts of Hezekiah, all of his powerful <transChange type="added">deeds</transChange>, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought the water into the city, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah?</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Hezekiah slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and Manasseh his son became king in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Hephzibah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, according to the detestable things of the nations that Yahweh had driven out from the presence of the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">He returned and rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed. He erected altars for Baal and made a pole of Asherah worship just as Ahab king of Israel had made, and he bowed down to all of the host of heaven and served them.</verse>
    <verse num="4">He built altars in the temple of Yahweh <transChange type="added">about</transChange> which Yahweh had said, "I will put my name in Jerusalem."</verse>
    <verse num="5">He built an altar to all of the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="6">He made his son pass through the fire, practiced soothsaying and divination, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He increased the doing of evil in the eyes of Yahweh to provoke him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">He put the image of the Asherah that he had made in the temple which Yahweh had said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this temple and in Jerusalem which I have chosen from all of the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.</verse>
    <verse num="8">I will not again make the feet of Israel wander from the land which I have given to their ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> if they only observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, as far as the law that Moses my servant commanded them."</verse>
    <verse num="9">But Manasseh did not listen and tempted them to do evil more than the nations that Yahweh destroyed before the presence of the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="10">So Yahweh spoke by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="11">"Because Manasseh the king of Judah committed these detestable things <transChange type="added">and</transChange> did evil more than the Amorites did who were before him and caused even Judah to sin with his idols,</verse>
    <verse num="12">therefore, thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, 'Look, I am bringing disaster upon Jerusalem and Judah about which the two ears of all who hear it will tingle.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plumb line of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes the dish; he wipes it and turns it on its face.</verse>
    <verse num="14">I will give up the remainder of my inheritance, and I will give them into the hand of their enemies. They shall become as prey and as spoil for all their enemies,</verse>
    <verse num="15">because they have done evil in my eyes and were provoking me from the day that their ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> came out from Egypt up to this day.'" </verse>
    <verse num="16">Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he filled Jerusalem {from one end to another},<note>Literally "end to end"</note> apart from his sin which he caused Judah to sin by doing evil in the eyes of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="17">The remainder of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he committed, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah?</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Manasseh slept with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> and was buried in the garden of his palace, in the garden of Uzza. Amon his son became king in his place. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah.</verse>
    <verse num="20">He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh as Manasseh his father had done.</verse>
    <verse num="21">He walked in all of the way which his father had walked, and he served the idols which his father had served and bowed down to them.</verse>
    <verse num="22">He abandoned Yahweh the God of his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> and did not walk in the way of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="23">The servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his palace.</verse>
    <verse num="24">But the people of the land killed all who conspired against the king and made Josiah his son king in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="25">The remainder of the acts of Amon that he did, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah?</verse>
    <verse num="26">They buried him in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son became king in place of him. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He did right in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in all of the way of David his ancestor<note>Or "father"</note> and did not turn aside to the right or to the left. </verse>
    <verse num="3">It happened in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent <transChange type="added">word to</transChange> Shaphan the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the secretary of the temple of Yahweh, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="4">"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, and let them count the money being brought to the temple of Yahweh which the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people,</verse>
    <verse num="5">and let them give it into the hand of those appointed doers of the work at the temple of Yahweh. Let them give it to the doers of the work who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> at the temple of Yahweh to repair the breach of the temple:</verse>
    <verse num="6">to the skilled craftsmen, to the builders, to the masons, and to buy timber and hewing stones to repair the temple.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Only the money being given to them is not to be accounted for by them, for they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> dealing with honesty." </verse>
    <verse num="8">Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the scroll of the Torah in the temple of Yahweh," and Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan and he read it.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Shaphan the secretary came to the king and returned the king a word, and he said, "Your servant poured out the money found in the temple, and they have given it into the hand of the doers of the work appointed <transChange type="added">over</transChange> the temple of Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king saying, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll." Then Shaphan read before the king. </verse>
    <verse num="11">When the king heard the words of the scroll of the Torah, he tore his clothes.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Acbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the servant of the king, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="13">"Go, inquire of Yahweh for me and for the people and for all of Judah concerning the words of this scroll <transChange type="added">that was</transChange> found. For the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us <transChange type="added">is</transChange> great because our ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> did not listen to the words of this scroll to do according to all that is written concerning us!" </verse>
    <verse num="14">So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah the son of Harhas, the keeper of the robes. Now she <transChange type="added">was</transChange> living in Jerusalem in the second district. Then they spoke to her,</verse>
    <verse num="15">and she said to them, "Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, 'Say to the man who sent you to me,</verse>

    <verse num="17">because they have abandoned me and they have burned incense to other gods, provoking me to anger with all of the works of their hands. My wrath shall be kindled against this place and not be quenched.'"</verse>
    <verse num="18">And to the king of Judah who sent all of you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall say to him, "Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, '<transChange type="added">Concerning</transChange> the words that you have heard,</verse>
    <verse num="19">because you have a responsive heart, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh when you heard how I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants to become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before my face, I have also heard, declares Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Therefore look, I am gathering you to your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and you shall be gathered to your tombs in peace. Your eyes will not see all of the disaster that I am bringing onto this place.'" '" Then they {reported the word}<note>Literally "they returned a word"</note> to the king. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="23">
    <verse num="1">So the king sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange>, and all of the elders of Judah and Jerusalem gathered to him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then the king went up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the temple of Yahweh, and all of the men of Judah and all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, <transChange type="added">including</transChange> the priests, the prophets, and all of the people from smallest to greatest; and in their {hearing}<note>Literally "ears"</note> he read all of the words of the scroll of the covenant that had been found in the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then the king stood by the pillar, and he {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant before Yahweh, to go after Yahweh and to keep his commands and his warnings and his statutes, with all of <transChange type="added">his</transChange> heart and with his all of his soul, to keep the words of this covenant written on this scroll. Then all of the people {joined}<note>Literally "stood"</note> in the covenant. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the {king}<note>That is, Josiah</note> commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the second priests, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of the temple of Yahweh all of the objects made for Baal and for the Asherah and for all the host of heaven, and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and then he carried their ashes to Bethel.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He removed the priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained <transChange type="added">to</transChange> burn incense on the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem and who offered incense to, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="6">He brought out the Asherah image from the temple of Yahweh outside of Jerusalem to the Wadi of the Kidron and burnt it {there};<note>Literally "at the wadi of the Kidron"</note> then he pulverized <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to dust and threw its dust upon the tombs of the children of the people.</verse>
    <verse num="7">He tore down the shrines of the male shrine prostitutes which were in the temple of Yahweh, where the women were weaving shrines for the Asherah.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then he brought all of the priests from the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where the priests from Geba up to Beersheba burned incense. He tore down the high places of the gates which were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which were on the left of each gate of the city.</verse>
    <verse num="9">However, the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread in the midst of their relatives.</verse>
    <verse num="10">He defiled the Topheth which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, {to prevent}<note>Literally "so that not"</note> anyone causing his sons or his daughters to pass through the fire for Molech.</verse>
    <verse num="11">He kept the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun from coming to the temple of Yawheh at the side room of Nathan-Melech the eunuch, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the court; and the chariots of the sun he burned with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="12">The altars which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the temple of Yahweh, the king tore down and ran from there and threw their ashes into the Wadi Kidron.</verse>
    <verse num="13">The high places which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> east of Jerusalem, which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> on the south of the Mountain of Destruction which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab and for Molech the detestable thing of the {Ammonites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> the king defiled.</verse>
    <verse num="14">He also broke into pieces the stone pillars and cut down the Asherah poles and covered their sites <transChange type="added">with</transChange> human bones. </verse>
    <verse num="15">Moreover, the altar which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Bethel, the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, had built, even that altar and the high place, <transChange type="added">Josiah</transChange> tore down. Then he burned down the high place and crushed <transChange type="added">the</transChange> pole of Asherah worship to dust and burned it with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="16">When Josiah turned and saw the tombs which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> there on the hill, he sent and took the bones from the tombs and burned <transChange type="added">them</transChange> on the altar. <transChange type="added">Thus</transChange> he defiled them according to the word of Yahweh that the man of God had proclaimed who had proclaimed these things.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then he said, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this gravestone that I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> seeing?" The men of the city said to him, "<transChange type="added">This is the</transChange> tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel."</verse>
    <verse num="18">So Josiah said, "Let him rest and let no man move his bones." So they left his bones undisturbed with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Moreover, all of the shrines of the high places which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the towns of Samaria which the kings of Israel had made to provoke <transChange type="added">Yahweh</transChange>, Josiah removed, and he did to them like all of the deeds he had done in Bethel.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then he slaughtered all of the priests of the high places who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> there, on the altars, and he burned the bones of the humans on them. Then he returned <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse num="21">Then the king commanded all of the people, saying, "Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as has been written on the scroll of this covenant."</verse>
    <verse num="22">For they had not kept this Passover from the days of the judges who had judged over Israel {or}<note>Or "and"</note> <transChange type="added">during</transChange> the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="23">But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was kept for Yahweh in Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse num="24">Moreover, the mediums and the spiritists, the household gods and the idols, and all of the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, Josiah removed in order to establish the words of the law written on the scroll that Hilkiah the priest had found <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="25">There was not a king like him before him, who turned to Yahweh with all of his heart and with all of his soul and with all of his might according to the law<note>Or "Torah"</note> of Moses, nor did one arise like him afterwards. </verse>
    <verse num="26">However, Yahweh did not turn from the fierceness of his great anger which was kindled against Judah because of all of the provocations <transChange type="added">with</transChange> which Manasseh had provoked him.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Yahweh had said, "Even Judah I will remove from my face, as I have removed Israel; I will reject this city that I have chosen, even Jerusalem and the house <transChange type="added">of</transChange> which I said, 'My name shall be there'!" </verse>
    <verse num="28">The remainder of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah?</verse>
    <verse num="29">In his days, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. King Josiah went to meet him, and he<note>That is, Neco</note> killed him at Megiddo as soon as he saw him.</verse>
    <verse num="30">So his servants drove him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, and they brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father. </verse>
    <verse num="31">Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.</verse>
    <verse num="32">He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to all his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> had done.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Then Pharaoh Neco confined him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, from reigning in Jerusalem, and imposed a levy on the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. </verse>
    <verse num="34">Then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of Josiah his father, and he changed his name to Jehoiakim. Then he took Jehoahaz and brought <transChange type="added">him</transChange> to Egypt, and he died there.</verse>
    <verse num="35">The silver and the gold Jehoiakim gave to Pharaoh; however, he taxed the land to give the silver {to meet the demands of Pharaoh}.<note>Literally "on the hunger of Pharaoh"</note> Each according to assessment, he exacted <transChange type="added">payment</transChange> of the silver and the gold from the people of the land to give to Pharaoh Neco. </verse>
    <verse num="36">Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Zebudah,<note>According to the reading tradition (Qere); Kethib reads "Zebidah"</note> the daughter of Pedaiah from Rumah.</verse>
    <verse num="37">He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> had done. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="24">
    <verse num="1">In his days, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up <transChange type="added">because</transChange> Jehoiakim had become his servant <transChange type="added">for</transChange> three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So Yahweh sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, raiding bands of Aram, raiding bands of Moab, and raiding bands of the {Ammonites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> He had sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Yahweh that he had spoken by the hand of his servants the prophets.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Surely, it was {on the command}<note>Literally "on the mouth"</note> of Yahweh against Judah to remove them from his sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Also, <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the blood of the innocent that he had shed--and he filled Jerusalem <transChange type="added">with</transChange> innocent blood--Yahweh was not willing to forgive.</verse>
    <verse num="5">The remainder of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah?</verse>
    <verse num="6">So Jehoiakim slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The king of Egypt did not again come out from his land, for the king of Babylon had taken <transChange type="added">territory</transChange> from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Nehushta daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that his father had done. </verse>
    <verse num="10">At that time, the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem, and the city came under the siege.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city <transChange type="added">while</transChange> his servants were besieging it.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Jehoiachin king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, his mother, his servants, his commanders, and his court officials. The king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then he took from there all of the treasures of the temple of Yahweh and the treasures of the palace of the king. He cut up all of the vessels of gold which Solomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of Yahweh, as Yahweh had foretold.</verse>
    <verse num="14">He deported all of Jerusalem: all of the commanders, ten thousand of the skilled warriors, and the artisans; no one was left over except the poorest of the people of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="15">He deported Jehoiachin to Babylon; the mother of the king, the wives of the king, his court officials, and the citizenry of the land he caused to go into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:</verse>
    <verse num="16">of all of the skilled men, seven thousand, and <transChange type="added">of</transChange> the skilled craftsmen and the artisans, one thousand. All of the mighty warriors {fit for war}<note>Literally "doers of war"</note> the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his uncle king in his place and changed his name <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Zedekiah. </verse>
    <verse num="18">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.</verse>
    <verse num="19">He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh <transChange type="added">just</transChange> like all that Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
    <verse num="20">For it happened because of the anger of Yahweh, in Jerusalem and in Judah, until they were cast out from his presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="25">
    <verse num="1">It happened that in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came, he and his army, against Jerusalem. He encamped against it and built siege works against it all around.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So the city came under siege until the eleventh year of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="3">In the ninth month, the famine became severe in the city, and there was no food for the people of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the city was breached, and all of the men of war <transChange type="added">entered</transChange> by night by way of the gate between the wall which was by the garden of the king, and the Chaldeans <transChange type="added">were</transChange> against the city all around, so he<note>That is, Zedekiah</note> left by the way of the Arabah.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the Arabah of Jericho, and all of his army scattered from him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">So they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and {they passed sentence on him}.<note>Literally "they spoke justice with him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; then they blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in bronze fetters and brought him <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Babylon. </verse>
    <verse num="8">In the fifth month, on the seventh of the month, that is, the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, a commander of the imperial guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He burned the temple of Yahweh, the palace of the king, and all of the houses of Jerusalem; every large house he burned with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="10">He and all the army of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Chaldeans who <transChange type="added">were with</transChange> the imperial guard tore down the wall of Jerusalem all around.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The remainder of the people left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the remainder of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard deported. </verse>
    <verse num="12">But the poor of the land the commander of the imperial guard left for the vineyards and for tilling. </verse>
    <verse num="13">The bronze pillars which <transChange type="added">were in</transChange> the temple<note>Or "house"</note> of Yahweh, the water carts, and the bronze sea that was in the temple of Yahweh, the Chaldeans broke into pieces and carried their bronze to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="14">The pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the dishes, and the vessels of bronze with which they served there, they took.</verse>
    <verse num="15">The firepans and the basins, whatever was gold, the commander of the imperial guard took <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the gold and whatever was silver, <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the silver.</verse>
    <verse num="16">The two pillars, the one sea, and the water cart which Solomon had made for the temple of Yahweh, there was no weighing to the bronze of all of these vessels.</verse>
    <verse num="17">The height of the one pillar <transChange type="added">was</transChange> eighteen cubits; a bronze capital was on it, with the height of the capital <transChange type="added">being</transChange> three cubits. The latticework and pomegranates on the capital all around were bronze, and likewise on the latticework for the second pillar. </verse>
    <verse num="18">Then the commander of the imperial guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and three of the threshold keepers.</verse>
    <verse num="19">From the city he took one court official who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> chief officer over the men of war, five men {from the king's council}<note>Literally "from those who saw the face of the king"</note> who were found in the city, the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men from the people of the land being found in the city.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then the king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath; thus Judah was removed from its land. </verse>
    <verse num="22">Now <transChange type="added">as far as</transChange> the people left in Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon left behind, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan over them.</verse>
    <verse num="23">When all of the commanders of the troops heard, they and the men, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, <transChange type="added">even</transChange> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seriah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and he said to them, "You must not be afraid because of the Chaldeans. Settle in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and may it go well with you."</verse>
    <verse num="25">But it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama from the offspring of the kingship came, and ten men with him, and they struck down Gedaliah so that he died with the Judeans and with the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then all the people, from youngest to oldest, and the commanders of the troops, went <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Egypt, for they were afraid of the presence of the Chaldeans. </verse>
    <verse num="27">It happened in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month on the twenty-seventh of the month, lifted Evil-Merodach king of Babylon in the year that he became king, the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah from the house of imprisonment.</verse>
    <verse num="28">He spoke {kindly}<note>Literally "good things"</note> to him, and he gave him a better seat than the seat of the kings who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him in Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="29">So he changed the clothes of his imprisonment, and he ate food continually in his presence all the days of his life.</verse>
    <verse num="30">His allowance was continually given to him from the king, {a portion every day}<note>Literally "a thing of day on his day"</note> all the days of his life. </verse>
