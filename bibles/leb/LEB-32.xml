<book num="Jonah">
  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">And the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">"Get up! Go to the great city Nineveh and cry out against her, because their evil has come up {before me}."<note>Literally "to my face"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">But Jonah set out to flee toward Tarshish from {the presence of}<note>Literally "from to face of"</note> Yahweh. And he went down <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Joppa and found a merchant ship going <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Tarshish, and paid her fare, and went on board her to go with them toward Tarshish from {the presence of}<note>Literally "from to face of"</note> Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="4">And Yahweh hurled a great wind upon the sea, and it was a great storm on the sea, and the merchant ship {was in danger of breaking up}.<note>Literally "threatened to be broken up"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">And the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they threw the {contents}<note>Literally "objects"</note> that were in the merchant ship into the sea to lighten it for them. And <transChange type="added">meanwhile</transChange> Jonah went down into the hold of the vessel and lay down and fell asleep.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the captain<note>Or "commander"</note> of the ship approached him and said to him, "Why are you {sound asleep}?<note>Literally "in a deep sleep"</note> Get up! Call on your god! Perhaps <transChange type="added">your</transChange> god<note>Literally "the god," with the article indicating previous reference</note> will take notice of us and we won't perish!"</verse>
    <verse num="7">And they said {to one another},<note>Literally "each to his friend/companion"</note> "Come, let us cast lots so that we may know on whose account this disaster <transChange type="added">has come</transChange> on us!" And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So they said to him, "Please tell us whoever <transChange type="added">is responsible that</transChange> this disaster <transChange type="added">has come</transChange> upon us! What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your occupation? And from where do you come? What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your country? And from which people <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you?"</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he said to them, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the men {were greatly afraid},<note>Literally "were afraid with a great fear"</note> and they said to him, "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this you have done?" because they<note>Literally "the men" but this is redundant in English</note> knew that he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> fleeing {from the presence of}<note>Literally "from before the face of"</note> Yahweh (because he had told them).</verse>
    <verse num="11">So they said to him, "What shall we do to you so that the sea may quiet down for us?" because the sea {was growing more and more tempestuous}.<note>Literally "going/growing and storming"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said to them, "Pick me up and hurl me into the sea so that the sea may quiet down for you, because I know that on account of me this great storm <transChange type="added">has come</transChange> upon you all."</verse>
    <verse num="13">But the men rowed <transChange type="added">hard</transChange> to bring <transChange type="added">the ship</transChange><note>Here the direct object is supplied from context</note> back to the dry land, and they could not <transChange type="added">do so</transChange> because the sea {was growing more and more tempestuous}<note>Literally "going/growing and storming"</note> against them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">So they cried out to Yahweh, and they said, "O Yahweh! Please do not let us perish because of this man's life, and {do not make us guilty of innocent blood},<note>Literally "do not give innocent blood on us"</note> because you, O Yahweh, did what you wanted."</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they picked Jonah up and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging.</verse>
    <verse num="16">So the men feared Yahweh {greatly},<note>Literally "with a great fear"</note> and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh and {made}<note>Literally "vowed"</note> vows. </verse>
    <verse num="17"><note>Jonah 1:17-2:10 in the English Bible is 2:1-11 in the Hebrew Bible</note> And Yahweh provided a large fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">And Jonah prayed to Yahweh his God from the belly of the fish</verse>
    <verse num="2">and said, </verse>
    <verse num="3">And you threw me <transChange type="added">into the</transChange> deep, into the heart of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> seas, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sea currents surrounded me; all your breakers and your surging waves passed over me.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I said, 'I am banished<note>Or "expelled," or "driven away"</note> from your sight; how<note>Or "however, I will continue to look on your holy temple"</note> {will I continue to look}<note>Literally "will I do again to look," meaning "will I continue to look"</note> {on your holy temple}?'<note>Literally "on the temple of your holiness"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5"><transChange type="added">The</transChange> waters encompassed me up to <transChange type="added">my</transChange> neck; <transChange type="added">the</transChange> deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.</verse>
    <verse num="6">I went down to the foundations of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mountains; the Underworld--its bars <transChange type="added">were</transChange> around me forever. But you brought up my life from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> pit, Yahweh my God.</verse>
    <verse num="7">When my life was ebbing away from me, I remembered Yahweh, and my prayer came to you, {to your holy temple}.<note>Literally "to the temple of your holiness"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Those who worship vain idols forsake their loyal love.<note>This could mean (1) they forsake the loyal love they should show to God or (2) they forfeit <transChange type="added">forsake</transChange> the loyal love that God would have shown to them</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">But I, with a voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you; I will fulfill what I have vowed. Deliverance<note>Or "salvation"</note> <transChange type="added">belongs</transChange> to Yahweh!"</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out on the dry land. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">And the word of Yahweh came to Jonah a second <transChange type="added">time</transChange>, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">"Get up! Go to Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim to it the message that I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> telling you."</verse>
    <verse num="3">So Jonah got up<note>Or "set out"</note> and went to Nineveh according to the word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh was {an extraordinarily great city}<note>Literally "a great city to God" or "a great city to <transChange type="added">the</transChange> gods," a disputed phrase which may refer to God's estimate or ownership of Nineveh, to the presence of many idols, or an idiom referring to the size of Nineveh (this translation takes the last view)</note>--a journey of three days <transChange type="added">across</transChange>.<note>This phrase may also refer to a journey on which business was done, so that "three days" is the total elapsed time</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">And Jonah began to go into the city a journey of one day, and he cried out and said, "Forty more days and Nineveh will be demolished!"<note>Or "overthrown"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">And the people of Nineveh believed in God, and they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth--from the greatest of them {to the least important}.<note>Literally "to the smallest of them"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="6">And the news reached the king of Nineveh, and he rose from his throne and removed his royal robe, put on sackcloth, and sat in the ashes.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he had a proclamation made, and said, </verse>
    <verse num="8">And <transChange type="added">the</transChange> human beings and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> animals must be covered <transChange type="added">with</transChange> sackcloth! And they must call forcefully to God, and each must turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his<note>Hebrew "their"</note> hands.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Who knows? God may relent and change his mind and turn {from his blazing anger}<note>Literally "from the heat of his anger"</note> {so that}<note>Hebrew "and"</note> we will not perish." </verse>
    <verse num="10">And God saw their deeds--that they turned from their evil ways--and God changed his mind about the evil that he had said <transChange type="added">he would</transChange> bring upon them, and he did not do <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.<note>Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">And this<note>Hebrew "it"</note> {was greatly displeasing}<note>Literally "was displeasing <transChange type="added">with</transChange> great displeasure"</note> to Jonah, and {he became furious}.<note>Literally "it was hot for him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">And he prayed to Yahweh and said, "O Yahweh, <transChange type="added">was</transChange> this not {what I said}<note>Literally "my word"</note> while I was in my homeland? Therefore {I originally fled}<note>Literally "I did the first time to flee"</note> to Tarshish, because I knew that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger {and having great steadfast love},<note>Literally "and great of steadfast love"</note> and one who relents concerning calamity.<note>That is, calamity sent by God as judgment</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">And so then, Yahweh, please take my life from me, because <transChange type="added">for</transChange> me death <transChange type="added">is</transChange> better than life!"</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Yahweh said, "{Is it right for you to be angry}?"<note>Literally "Rightfully is it hot for you"; some take this to mean "Are you so very angry?" (Targum Jonah 4:4; see also JPS, NEB, NET)</note> </verse>
    <verse num="5">And Jonah went out from the city and sat <transChange type="added">down</transChange> east of the city, and he made for himself a shelter there. And he sat under it in the shade, {waiting to see}<note>Literally "until he would see"</note> what would happen with the city.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Yahweh God appointed a plant,<note>Probably a castor oil plant, though some have suggested some type of gourd plant</note> and he made it grow up over Jonah to be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. And Jonah {was very glad}<note>Literally "was glad with great joy"</note> about the plant.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So God appointed a worm {at daybreak}<note>Literally "at the coming up of the dawn"</note> the next day, and it attacked the plant, and it withered.</verse>
    <verse num="8">{And when the sun rose},<note>Literally "and it happened at the rising of the sun"</note> God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head and he grew faint. {And he asked that he could die}<note>Literally "and he asked his soul to die"</note> and said, "My death <transChange type="added">is</transChange> better than my life!"</verse>
    <verse num="9">So God said to Jonah, "{Is it right for you to be angry}<note>Literally "rightfully is it hot for you"; some take this to mean "Are you so very angry?" (Targum Jonah 4:4; see also JPS, NEB, NET)</note> about the plant?" And he said, "{It is right for me to be angry enough to die}!"<note>Literally "Rightfully it is hot for me until death"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="10">But Yahweh said, "You are troubled about the plant, for which you did not labor nor cause it to grow. {It grew up in a night and it perished in a night}!<note>Literally "Which was a son of a night and <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a son of a night it perished"</note></verse>
    <verse num="11">And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, the great city, {in which there are}<note>Literally "which there are in it"</note> more {than one hundred and twenty thousand}<note>Literally "than two ten myriad" (12 x 10,000)</note> people who do not know right from left,<note>"<transChange type="added">hand</transChange>" is often supplied, but it is not clear just what deficiency is meant by this expression, which occurs only here in biblical Hebrew</note> plus many animals?" </verse>
