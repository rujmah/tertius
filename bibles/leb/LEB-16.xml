    <verse num="1">The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. </verse>
    <verse num="2">and one of my brothers, Hanani, came with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had escaped the captivity and about Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="3">They replied to me, "The survivors in the province who have survived the captivity are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned in the fire." </verse>
    <verse num="4">When I heard these words, I sat and wept and mourned for days, and I was fasting and praying before the God of the heavens.</verse>
    <verse num="5">I said, "O Yahweh God of the heavens, the great and awesome one who keeps the covenant and loyal love for the ones who love him and for those who keep his commands.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Please, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer of your servant that I am praying before you by day and by night for your servants, the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> and confessing the sins of the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> that we have sinned against you. I and my father's house have sinned.</verse>
    <verse num="7">We have certainly offended you and have not kept the commands, regulations, and judgments that you have commanded your servant Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Please, remember the word that you have commanded to your servant Moses, saying, 'If you act unfaithfully I will scatter you all among the nations.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, even though all of your outcasts are at the furthest parts of heaven, I will gather them and bring them to the place which I have chosen to make my name dwell.'</verse>
    <verse num="10">They are your servants and your people whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand.</verse>
    <verse num="11">O Lord, please let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight to revere in your name. Please, let your servant be successful this day and give him compassion before this man." </verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">It happened in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I carried the wine and gave it to the king. And I had never been sad before the king.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So the king said to me, "Why is your face sad since you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of the heart." And I was very much afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad when the city of my ancestors'<note>Or "fathers'"</note> burial site<note>Hebrew "sites"</note> is ruined and her gates are consumed by fire?"</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the king said to me, "What is your request?" So I prayed to the God of the heavens.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant has <transChange type="added">found</transChange> favor in your presence, <transChange type="added">I ask</transChange> that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors'<note>Or "fathers'"</note> burial sites, so that I may rebuild it." </verse>
    <verse num="6">With the queen sitting beside him, the king said to me, "How long will your journey be and when will you return?" So it pleased the king and he sent me, and I set for him an appointed time.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then I said to the king, "If it is good for the king, let letters be given to me for the governors <transChange type="added">in the province</transChange> Beyond the River, that they may let me pass until I come to Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Also, a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king's land reserve, that he should give me timber for laying the beams for the gates of the citadel of the house and for the walls of the city, and for the house which I will enter." And the king gave <transChange type="added">permission</transChange> to me, according to the good hand of God on me. </verse>
    <verse num="9">I came to the governors of <transChange type="added">the province</transChange> Beyond the River, and I gave them the letters of the king. Then the king sent troop commanders and horses with me.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But when Sanballat the Horonite and the Ammonite servant Tobiah heard <transChange type="added">this</transChange>, {they were greatly displeased}<note>Literally "it was a great disaster for them"</note> that a person had come to seek the welfare of the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="11">I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days.</verse>
    <verse num="12">I got up during the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anybody what my God put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. No animal <transChange type="added">was</transChange> with me except the animal that I was riding on.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I went out during the night at the gate of the valley by the Dragon spring and to the Dung Gate. And I examined the walls in Jerusalem and its gates that had been destroyed by the fire.</verse>
    <verse num="14">I crossed over to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool, but there was no place for {my mount}<note>Literally "the animal under me"</note> to cross over.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So I went up by the valley during the night and was examining the wall. Then I returned and came to the Valley Gate and returned.</verse>
    <verse num="16">The prefects did not know where I had gone and what I was doing. I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the prefects, and the rest of the workers. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Then I said to them, "You see the misery that we are in, that Jerusalem is ruined and its gates burned by the fire. Come, build the walls of Jerusalem and we shall no longer be a disgrace."</verse>
    <verse num="18">I told them of the good hand of my God that was upon me and surely the words of the king that were spoken to me. And they said, "Let us arise and build!" And they strengthened their hands for <transChange type="added">this</transChange> good work.</verse>
    <verse num="19">But Sanballat the Horonite, the Ammonite servant Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard it, and they mocked and despised us, saying, "What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then I answered and said to them, "The God of the heavens himself will let us succeed, and we his servants shall arise and build. But for you there is no share, right, or memorial in Jerusalem." </verse>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1"><note>Nehemiah 4:1-23 in the English Bible is 3:33-4:17 in the Hebrew Bible</note> Now it happened when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, <transChange type="added">he</transChange> became angry and greatly provoked, and he mocked the Jews.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then he said before his brothers and the army of Samaria, "What are the feeble Jews doing? Will they restore <transChange type="added">these things</transChange> for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the piles of rubble--even those burned up?" </verse>
    <verse num="3">Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him and said, "Their wall of stone that they are building would break down if a fox went on it!" </verse>
    <verse num="4">Hear, our God, for we are despised. Turn their scorn on their head and give them over to plunder in the land of captivity.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Do not cover their guilt, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before you. They have {provoked the builders to anger}.<note>Literally "provoked anger before the builders"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="6">So we rebuilt the wall, and all of the wall was joined up to half <transChange type="added">its height</transChange>. For the people had a heart to do <transChange type="added">it</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="7">Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem were going forward and the gaps were being closed, they were very angry.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So all of them plotted together to come fight against Jerusalem and to make trouble for it.</verse>
    <verse num="9">So we prayed to our God and set up a guard against them day and night. </verse>
    <verse num="10">But Judah said, "The strength of the carriers is failing, and there is too much dirt, and we are not able to build at the wall."</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then our enemies said, "They will not know nor see until we come upon them and will kill them and stop the work."</verse>
    <verse num="12">When the Jews who lived beside them came, they said to us ten times, "From all of the places where they live, <transChange type="added">they will come up</transChange> against us."</verse>
    <verse num="13">I stationed the people behind the deepest part of the wall in the open places according to their families, with their swords, spears, and bows.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And I looked, got up, and said to the nobles, prefects, and the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses." </verse>
    <verse num="15">It happened when our enemies heard that their plan was known to us, that God had frustrated <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, and we all returned to the wall--each to his work.</verse>
    <verse num="16">From that day, half of my servants were working on craftsmanship, half were holding spears, small shields, bows, and breastplates. The commanders were behind the whole house of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="17">The ones who were building the wall and the ones {who carried the materials}<note>Literally "who carried the burden"</note> were carrying in one hand while doing the task, and with the other hand were grasping a weapon.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Each of the builders had his sword tied to his side while building. And the man who sounded the trumpet was beside me.</verse>
    <verse num="19">I said to the nobles, to the prefects, and to the rest of the people, "The work is great and widespread, and we are spread out over the wall far from each other.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, come together to us there. Our God will fight for us." </verse>
    <verse num="21">So we labored at the work, and half of them were holding the spears from dawn until the stars came out.</verse>
    <verse num="22">At the time I also said to the people, "Let each man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they will be a guard for us in the night and work in the day."</verse>
    <verse num="23">So neither I nor my brothers nor my young men nor the men of the guard who were behind me took off our clothes. Each one <transChange type="added">kept</transChange> his weapon <transChange type="added">even</transChange> in the water. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Now there was a great cry of distress of the people and of their wives <transChange type="added">against</transChange> their Jewish brothers.</verse>
    <verse num="2">There were those who were saying, "Our sons and daughters, we are many. We must get grain so that we may eat and live."</verse>
    <verse num="3">There were also those saying, "We have pledged our fields and our vineyards and our houses so that we can get grain in the famine."</verse>
    <verse num="4">And there were those who were saying, "We have borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards for the tax of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our sons are like their sons. Look, we are subduing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and there are some from our daughters being molested. {We are powerless},<note>Literally "There is no power in our hand"</note> and our fields and vineyards <transChange type="added">belong</transChange> to others." </verse>
    <verse num="6">I was very angry when I heard their shouts and these words.</verse>
    <verse num="7">I thought over this in my heart, and then I quarreled with the nobles and the prefects. I said to them, "You yourselves are taking interest from your own brother!" So I called the great assembly against them,</verse>
    <verse num="8">and I said to them: "We ourselves have bought back our brothers the Jews who were sold to the nations as we were able. But now you yourselves have sold your brothers so they may be sold to us!" They were silent and could not find a word <transChange type="added">to say</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="9">So I said, "The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God <transChange type="added">to prevent</transChange> the disgrace from the nations, our enemies?</verse>
    <verse num="10">Also, I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please stop <transChange type="added">taking</transChange> this interest.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Please restore to them this day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, their houses, and the interest on the money, the grain, the grape juice, and the olive oil that you have been taking from them."</verse>
    <verse num="12">So they said, "We will restore it and will not request <transChange type="added">anything more</transChange>. So we will do as you say." Then I called the priests and made them take an oath to do this promise.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I also shook out my garment and said, "This is how God will shake out everyone from his house who will not keep this promise. So this is how his possessions will be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said, "Amen!" And they praised Yahweh, and the people kept this promise. </verse>
    <verse num="14">Moreover, from the appointed day I was made their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes--twelve years. My brothers and I did not eat the food <transChange type="added">allowance</transChange> of the governor.</verse>
    <verse num="15">The former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people, and they took food and wine from them, besides forty shekels. Also, their servants controlled the people, but I did not do so because of the fear of God.</verse>
    <verse num="16">I also devoted myself to the work of this wall, and we did not buy land. All of my servants were gathered for the work.</verse>
    <verse num="17">One hundred and fifty men, prefects and Jews, and those who came to us from the nations around us, <transChange type="added">were</transChange> at my table.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Now what was prepared each day for me was one ox, six choice sheep, and birds. And every ten days all <transChange type="added">kinds of</transChange> wine were made. But for this I did not demand the food <transChange type="added">allowance</transChange> of the governor because the slavery was too heavy on this people.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Remember me for good, my God, all that I have done for this people. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that no gap was left in it--though up to that time I had not erected doors in the gates--</verse>
    <verse num="2">Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, "Come and let us meet together in <transChange type="added">one of</transChange> the villages in the plain of Ono." But they planned to do evil to me.</verse>
    <verse num="3">So I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I am not able to come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you all?"</verse>
    <verse num="4">And they sent a message to me four times like this, and I returned an answer like this to them.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Sanballat sent his servant with an open letter, <transChange type="added">another</transChange> word like this to me a fifth time, in his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="6">In it was written, "It has been reported among the nations, and Gashmu also is saying it, that you and the Jews are considering rebellion. Therefore, truly you are building the wall and you are becoming their king, according to these words.</verse>
    <verse num="7">You have also set up prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, saying, '<transChange type="added">There is</transChange> a king in Judah.' And now it will be proclaimed to the king according to these words. Now, come and we will plan together."</verse>
    <verse num="8">So I sent to him saying, "None of these words you have spoken has happened. You are indeed saying <transChange type="added">things</transChange> created in your own mind"--</verse>
    <verse num="9">for all of them <transChange type="added">sought</transChange> to frighten us, saying, "their hands will not do the work." And now, <transChange type="added">God</transChange>, strengthen my hands. </verse>
    <verse num="10">Now I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined <transChange type="added">at home</transChange>, and he said, "Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you--during the night they are coming to kill you."</verse>
    <verse num="11">But I said, "Should a man like me run away? And would a man like me go into the temple so that he can save his life? I will not go in!"</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then I look and realized God had not sent him; rather, he had spoken the prophecy against me <transChange type="added">because</transChange> Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For this reason he was hired: to frighten <transChange type="added">me</transChange> so that I would act and sin, so that they would have a bad report so they could taunt me.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to their works, and also Noadiah the prophetess, and the remainder of the prophets who were frightening me. </verse>
    <verse num="15">So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.</verse>
    <verse num="16">When our enemies heard of this, all of the nations surrounding us were afraid and {lost their confidence}.<note>Literally "fell much in their eyes"</note> They knew that this work had been done with <transChange type="added">the help of</transChange> our God.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Also, in those days the nobles of Judah increasingly sent their letters to Tobiah, and <transChange type="added">letters</transChange> from Tobiah returned to them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jehohanan took as a wife the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.</verse>
    <verse num="19">They also were speaking of his good deeds in my presence, and they were sending my words out to him. Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">Now when the wall had been built and I had erected the doors and appointed the gatekeepers, singers, and the Levites,</verse>
    <verse num="2">I gave command over Jerusalem to my brother Hanani and Hananiah the commander of the citadel. For he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I said to them, "Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While they are standing guard let them shut and fasten the doors. And appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his post and another opposite his house."</verse>
    <verse num="4">The city <transChange type="added">was</transChange> widespread and large, but the people in it were few and no houses were rebuilt. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, the prefects, and the people to be enrolled. I found the book of the genealogy of those who first came back, and I found <transChange type="added">this</transChange> written upon it: </verse>
    <verse num="6">These are the people of the province who came up from captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each one to his city.</verse>
    <verse num="7">These came with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. </verse>
    <verse num="8">the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two.</verse>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">All of the people gathered as one to the public square before the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law<note>Hebrew torah</note> of Moses that Yahweh had commanded Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So Ezra the priest brought the law<note>Hebrew torah</note> before the assembly for <transChange type="added">each</transChange> man and woman to hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.</verse>
    <verse num="3">He read from it facing the public square before the Water Gate from dawn until noon that day, opposite the men, women, and those with understanding. The ears of all the people <transChange type="added">were attentive</transChange> to the book of the law.<note>Hebrew torah</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden podium that had been made for the occasion. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right. On his left <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, because he was above all of the people. When he opened it all the people stood up.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Ezra blessed Yahweh the great God, and all of the people answered, "Amen! Amen!" while lifting their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped Yahweh <transChange type="added">with their</transChange> noses to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites were teaching the people from the law<note>Hebrew torah</note> while the people were in their places.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So they read the book from the law<note>Hebrew torah</note> of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that they could understand the reading. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all of the people, "This day is holy to Yahweh your God. Do not mourn nor weep." For all of the people wept when they heard the words of the law.<note>Hebrew torah</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">Then he said to them, "Go, eat festive food and drink sweet drinks, and send a share to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our lord. Do not be grieved because the joy of Yahweh is your refuge."</verse>
    <verse num="11">So the Levites silenced all of the people, saying, "Silence, for this day is holy. Do not be grieved."</verse>
    <verse num="12">All of the people went to eat, to drink, to send a share, and to have great joy because they understood the words that they had made known to them. </verse>
    <verse num="13">On the second day the heads of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> of all the people, the priests, and the Levites gathered together to Ezra the scribe to study the words of the law.<note>Hebrew torah</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">They found written in the law,<note>Hebrew torah</note> which Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses, that the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> should live in booths during the festival of the seventh month,</verse>
    <verse num="15">and that they should proclaim and give voice in all of their cities in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out to the hill and bring olive tree branches, olive oil wood branches, myrtle shrub branches, palm tree branches, and other leafy tree branches to make booths, as it is written."</verse>
    <verse num="16">So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of the house of God, in the public square of the Water Gate, and in the public square of the Gate of Ephraim.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And all of the assembly of those who returned from captivity made booths and lived in the booths because the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> had not done it from the days of Jeshua son of Nun until that day. And there was very great joy.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he read from the scroll of the law<note>Hebrew torah</note> of God day by day from the first day up to the last day. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day there was an assembly according to the rule. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">On the twenty-fourth day of this month the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> gathered in fasting, in sackcloths, and with soil on them.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Those of the seed of Israel separated themselves from all of the foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">They stood up in their place and read from the book of the law<note>Hebrew torah</note> of Yahweh their God for a fourth part of the day, and for a fourth they were confessing and worshiping Yahweh their God.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani stood on the platform of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to Yahweh their God.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, "Stand up, bless Yahweh your God from everlasting until everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name that is being exalted above all blessing and praise! </verse>
    <verse num="6">"You alone are Yahweh. You alone have made the heavens, the heavens of the heavens, and all of their army, the earth and all that is in it, the waters and all that is in them. You give life to all of them, and the army of the heavens worship you.</verse>
    <verse num="7">You are Yahweh, the God who chose Abram and brought him from Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham.</verse>
    <verse num="8">You found his heart faithful before you and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite and the Girgashite--to give <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to his seed. And you have kept your word because you are righteous. </verse>
    <verse num="9">"You saw the misery of our ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> in Egypt, and you heard their shout at the Red Sea.</verse>
    <verse num="10">You gave signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all of his servants, and all of the people of his land because you knew that they acted arrogantly against them. You made a name for yourself, as it is this day.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And you divided the sea before them, and they passed through the sea on dry ground, but their pursuers you threw into the depths like a stone into mighty waters.</verse>
    <verse num="12">You led them by day with a column of cloud and with a column of fire by night, to give them light on the way that they were to go.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then you came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them right judgments and true teachings, good regulations and commandments.</verse>
    <verse num="14">You made known your holy Sabbath to them and gave them commandments, regulations, and law<note>Hebrew torah</note> by the hand of your servant Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="15">You gave them bread from heaven for their starvation, and you caused water to go out from a rock for their thirst. You told them to go in order to take into possession the land that you have sworn by your hand to give to them. </verse>
    <verse num="16">"But they and our ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> acted arrogantly and stiffened their neck and did not listen to your commandments.</verse>
    <verse num="17">They refused to listen and did not remember your wonders that you did among them. They stiffened their neck and in their rebellion {determined}<note>Literally "they gave head to"</note> to return to their slavery. But you are a God of forgiveness, gracious and compassionate, {slow to anger},<note>Literally "long of nose"</note> abundant in loyal love, so you did not abandon them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Even when they made for themselves a molten idol of a calf and said, 'This is your God who brought you out from Egypt,' and committed great blasphemies.</verse>
    <verse num="19">But you in your many mercies did not abandon them in the desert. The column of cloud <transChange type="added">that was</transChange> over them in the day did not cease to leave them on the way, and the column of fire by night <transChange type="added">that</transChange> gave light to them on the way that they went.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And you gave your good Spirit to instruct them and did not withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Forty years you sustained them in the desert--they were not in need. Their clothing did not wear out and their feet did not swell.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And you gave them kingdoms and nations and allotted them a portion. They took into possession the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan.</verse>
    <verse num="23">You made their children<note>Or "sons"</note> numerous like the stars of the heavens and brought them to the land that you told their ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> to enter in order to take possession.</verse>
    <verse num="24">So the children<note>Or "sons"</note> went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites; you gave them into their hand, and their kings and the nations of the land to do with them according to their pleasure.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And they captured fortified cities and a fertile land and took possession of houses filled with every good thing: hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, and many <transChange type="added">fruit</transChange> trees. They ate and became full, and they became fat and took delight in your great goodness. </verse>
    <verse num="26">"But they rebelled and were rebellious against you and cast your law<note>Hebrew torah</note> behind their back and killed your prophets, who had warned them to turn back to you, and they did great blasphemies.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Therefore you gave them into the hand of their enemy, and they brought trouble to them. Then in the time of their trouble they cried out to you, and you heard from the heavens, and according to your great compassions, you gave them saviors, and you saved them from the hand of their enemies.</verse>
    <verse num="28">But when they had rest they returned to doing evil before you, and you abandoned them in the hand of their enemies, and they ruled over them. Then they returned and cried out to you, and from the heavens you heard and many times rescued them according to your compassions.</verse>
    <verse num="29">You warned them so that they would return to your law.<note>Hebrew torah</note> Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to your commandments but sinned against your judgments that a person must do so that they may live. They turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not listen.</verse>
    <verse num="30">You were patient toward them for many years, and you have warned them by your spirit through the hand of your prophets, but they did not listen. So you gave them into the hand of the nations of the lands.</verse>
    <verse num="31">But in your great compassions you did not put an end to them, and you did not abandon them. For you are a gracious and compassionate God. </verse>
    <verse num="32">"And now our God, the great, mighty, and awesome God who keeps <transChange type="added">his</transChange> covenant and loyal love, do not belittle in your presence all of the hardship that is found in us, our kings, our officials, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and all of our people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="33">You are righteous in everything that has come on us, for you dealt faithfully, and we have acted wickedly.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Our kings, our officials, our priests, and our ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> did not keep your law<note>Hebrew torah</note> and did not listen to your commandments and statutes that you declared to them.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And in their kingdom and in the greatness you gave to them, and in the wide and fertile land that you gave before them, they did not serve you and did not turn from their evil deeds.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Behold, we are slaves to this day, and the land that you have given to our ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> to eat its fruits and <transChange type="added">enjoy</transChange> its goodness--behold, we are slaves in it!</verse>
    <verse num="37">Its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have given over us because of our sins, and <transChange type="added">they are</transChange> ruling over our dead bodies and our livestock at their pleasure. We are in great trouble. </verse>

    <verse num="1">These <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,</verse>

    <verse num="8">And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah and his brothers <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> in charge of the songs of thanksgiving.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Bakbukiah, Unno, their brothers <transChange type="added">stood</transChange> opposite them during service.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Jeshua fathered Jehoiakim; Jehoiakim fathered Eliashib; Eliashib <transChange type="added">fathered</transChange> Jehoiada;</verse>
    <verse num="11">Jehoiada fathered Jehonathan; Jehonathan fathered Jaddua. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Now in the days of Jehoiakim the priests and the heads of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;</verse>
    <verse num="13">of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;</verse>

    <verse num="22">In the days of Eliashib, Jehoiada, Jehohanan, and Jaddua the Levites were recorded as heads of the {families}.<note>Literally "fathers"</note> So <transChange type="added">these were</transChange> the priests <transChange type="added">during</transChange> the reign of Darius the Persian.</verse>
    <verse num="23">The descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Levi and the heads of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> were recorded in the scroll of the Annals until the days of Jehohanan son of Eliashib.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the heads of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their brothers opposite them, to praise and to give thanks by the command of David the man of God, section alongside section.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers standing guard at the storerooms of the gates.</verse>
    <verse num="26">These were in the days of Jehoiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jehozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe. </verse>
    <verse num="27">At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites from all of their places in order to bring them to Jerusalem to do the dedication with joy, thanksgivings, song and cymbals, stringed instruments and lyres.</verse>
    <verse num="28">The {singers}<note>Literally "sons of the singers"</note> were gathered from the circuit all around Jerusalem and from the villages of Netophathite,</verse>
    <verse num="29">from Beth Gilgal, from the field of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers built for themselves villages all around Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And the priests and the Levites purified themselves and purified the people, the gates, and the wall. </verse>
    <verse num="31">Then I brought the commanders of Judah up on to the wall. I appointed two great choirs; <transChange type="added">one went in</transChange> a procession to the right on the wall to the Dung Gate.</verse>
    <verse num="32">After them went Hoshaiah, half of the commanders of Judah,</verse>
    <verse num="33">Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,</verse>
    <verse num="34">Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,</verse>
    <verse num="35">and the {priests}<note>Literally "sons of the priests"</note> with trumpets; Zechariah son of Jehonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph;</verse>
    <verse num="36">and his brothers Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani with the instruments of the songs of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe <transChange type="added">went</transChange> before them.</verse>
    <verse num="37">At the Fountain Gate opposite them they went up the steps of the city of David, at the assent to the wall, over the house of David, and up to the Water Gate to the east. </verse>
    <verse num="38">Then the second choir went the opposite <transChange type="added">way</transChange>. I <transChange type="added">followed</transChange> after them with half of the people on the wall, from over the Tower of the Ovens up to the Wide Wall</verse>
    <verse num="39">and over the Gate of Ephraim, at the Old Gate, at the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, and <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the Sheep Gate. And they <transChange type="added">stopped and</transChange> stood at the Gate of the Guard.</verse>
    <verse num="40">So the two choirs stood in the house of God, and I and half of the prefects with me;</verse>
    <verse num="41">and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah with the trumpets;</verse>
    <verse num="42">Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jizrahiah the chief officer.</verse>
    <verse num="43">They offered on that day great sacrifices and rejoiced because God brought great joy to them. And the women and children also rejoiced. The joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar. </verse>
    <verse num="44">On that day men were appointed for the storehouse rooms, the offerings, the first fruits, and the tithes, in order to gather in them from the fields of the cities the requirements of the law<note>Hebrew torah</note> for the priests and Levites; for the joy of Judah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> upon the priests and Levites standing there.</verse>
    <verse num="45">They kept the responsibility of their God and the responsibility of cleansing, and the singers and gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon.</verse>
    <verse num="46">For in the days of David and Asaph from ancient times there was the head of the singers and a song of praise and thanksgiving to God.</verse>
    <verse num="47">So all of Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the daily food portions of the singers and gatekeepers. And they set apart <transChange type="added">that which was for</transChange> the Levites, and the Levites set apart <transChange type="added">that which was for</transChange> the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Aaron. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">On that day the book of Moses was read in the hearing of the people and it was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God</verse>
    <verse num="2">because they did not come to meet the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them in order to curse them--but our God changed the curse into a blessing.</verse>
    <verse num="3">So it happened when they heard the law<note>Hebrew torah</note> that they separated all of the foreign people from Israel. </verse>
    <verse num="4">Before this, Eliashib the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God--the one related to Tobiah--</verse>
    <verse num="5">prepared for <transChange type="added">Tobiah</transChange> a large chamber where they had formerly put the grain offering, the frankincense, the <transChange type="added">temple</transChange> objects, tithes of grain, wine, and oil commanded for the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the offerings of the priests.</verse>
    <verse num="6">During all of this, I was not in Jerusalem because in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. At the end of <transChange type="added">some</transChange> days I asked permission from the king <transChange type="added">to leave</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So I came to Jerusalem. And I came to learn of the wrong that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by making him a room in the courtyard of the house of God.</verse>
    <verse num="8">It was very displeasing for me, and I threw all of the objects from the house of Tobiah outside of the chamber.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And I spoke <transChange type="added">in order</transChange>, and they cleansed the chambers. Then I returned the objects of the house of God--the grain offering and the frankincense. </verse>
    <verse num="10">And then I came to learn that the food of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, the doers of the work, had gone back each to his field.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So I quarreled with the prefects, and I said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" And I gathered them and set them at their station.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So all of Judah brought the tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil into the storehouses.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I appointed as treasurer over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah from the Levites, and as their hand Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful. <transChange type="added">The responsibility given</transChange> to them was to distribute to their brothers.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my loyal acts which I have done in the house of my God and in his service. </verse>
    <verse num="15">In those days I saw in Judah <transChange type="added">people</transChange> treading the wine press on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps <transChange type="added">of grain</transChange> and loading them on donkeys along with wine, grapes and figs, and every kind of burden and bringing <transChange type="added">it all</transChange> to Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath. And I warned them at that time against selling food.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Tyrian men who lived in <transChange type="added">Jerusalem</transChange> brought fish and every kind of merchandise and sold <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on the Sabbath to the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Judah and in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="17">So I quarreled with the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the day of the Sabbath?</verse>
    <verse num="18">Did not your ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> do this also, and our God brought on us all of this disaster and on this city <transChange type="added">too</transChange>? Now you are adding fierce wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath!" </verse>
    <verse num="19">So when it became dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and said that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I appointed some of my young men over the gates <transChange type="added">to prevent</transChange> any {goods}<note>Literally "burden"</note> being brought in on the day of the Sabbath.</verse>
    <verse num="20">So the merchants and the sellers of merchandise spent the night outside of Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
    <verse num="21">But I warned them and said to them, "Why are you spending the night opposite the wall? If you do <transChange type="added">it again</transChange>, I will lay hands against you." From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And then I told two Levites that they must purify themselves and come to guard the gates in order to consecrate the day of the Sabbath. Remember this also, my God, and take pity on me according to the greatness of your loyal love. </verse>
    <verse num="23">Also in those days I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Half of their children spoke Ashdodite and could not speak Judean, but <transChange type="added">only</transChange> the tongues of other nations.</verse>
    <verse num="25">So I quarreled with them and cursed them and beat some of their men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath by God: "Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in this way? And among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Yet the foreign women made even him sin.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Should we listen to you all and do this great evil, acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?" </verse>
    <verse num="28">One from the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib, <transChange type="added">who was</transChange> the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonote <transChange type="added">was there</transChange>. I chased him away from me.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Remember them, my God, because of their defilements of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. </verse>
    <verse num="30">So I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established responsibilities for the priests and Levites, each in his own work,</verse>
    <verse num="31">a contribution of the wood offering at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good. </verse>
