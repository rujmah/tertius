    <verse num="9">I, John, your brother and co-sharer in the affliction and kingdom and steadfastness in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="10">I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great sound like a trumpet</verse>
    <verse num="11">saying, "What you see, write in a book and send <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea." </verse>

  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">After these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> I looked, and behold, an open door in heaven, and the former voice that I had heard like a trumpet speaking with me was saying, "Come up here and I will show you <transChange type="added">the things</transChange> which must take place after these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="2">Immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one was seated on the throne.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the one seated <transChange type="added">was</transChange> similar in appearance to jasper and carnelian stone, and a rainbow <transChange type="added">was</transChange> around the throne similar in appearance to emerald.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And around the throne <transChange type="added">were</transChange> twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones <transChange type="added">were</transChange> twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing, and on their heads <transChange type="added">were</transChange> gold crowns.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And from the throne came out lightnings and sounds and thunders, and seven torches of fire <transChange type="added">were</transChange> burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And before the throne <transChange type="added">was something</transChange> like a sea of glass, like crystal, and in the midst of the throne and around the throne <transChange type="added">were</transChange> four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the first living creature <transChange type="added">was</transChange> similar to a lion, and the second living creature <transChange type="added">was</transChange> similar to an ox, and the third living creature had a face like a man's, and the fourth living creature <transChange type="added">was</transChange> similar to an eagle flying.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the four living creatures, {each one}<note>Literally "one by one"</note> of them, had six wings apiece, full of eyes around and inside, and they do not have rest day and night, saying, </verse>
    <verse num="9">And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne, the one who lives {forever and ever}<note>Literally "for the ages of the ages"</note>,</verse>
    <verse num="10">the twenty-four elders fall down before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives {forever and ever}<note>Literally "for the ages of the ages"</note>, and put down their crowns before the throne, saying, </verse>
    <verse num="11">"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, because you have created all <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, and because of your will they existed and were created."</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">And I saw in the right hand of the one who is seated on the throne a scroll, written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?"</verse>
    <verse num="3">And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep! Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals. </verse>
    <verse num="6">And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as though slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he came and took <transChange type="added">the scroll</transChange><note>A very few less important manuscripts supply the words "the scroll" here; in Greek the direct object ("the scroll") is frequently understood anyway and must be supplied in the English translation</note> from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one of whom had a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they were singing a new song, saying, </verse>
    <verse num="10">and made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign on the earth."</verse>
    <verse num="11">And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and of the living creatures and of the elders, and their number was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands times thousands,</verse>
    <verse num="12">saying with a loud voice, </verse>
    <verse num="13">And I heard every creature that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and in the sea and everything in them saying, </verse>
    <verse num="14">And the four living creatures were saying, "Amen!" and the elders fell down and worshiped. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">And I watched when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying like the sound of thunder, "Come!"</verse>
    <verse num="2">And I looked, and behold, a white horse, and the one seated on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and in order that he might conquer. </verse>
    <verse num="3">And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come!"</verse>
    <verse num="4">And another horse came out, fiery red, and it was granted to the one seated on it to take peace from the earth, and that they would slaughter one another, and a large sword was given to him. </verse>
    <verse num="5">And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, "Come!" And I looked, and behold, a black horse, and the one seated on it had a balance scale in his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And I heard <transChange type="added">something</transChange> like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not damage the olive oil and the wine!" </verse>
    <verse num="7">And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard a voice from the fourth living creature saying, "Come!"</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I looked, and behold, a pale green horse, and the one seated on it {was named}<note>Literally "name to him"</note> Death, and Hades followed after him. And authority was granted to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill by the sword and by famine and by pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth. </verse>
    <verse num="9">And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had,</verse>
    <verse num="10">and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "{How long}<note>Literally "until when"</note>, holy and true Lord, will you not judge and avenge our blood from those who live on the earth?"</verse>
    <verse num="11">And to each one of them a white robe was given, and it was said to them that they should rest yet a short time, until <transChange type="added">the number of</transChange> their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed as they <transChange type="added">had been</transChange> were completed also. </verse>
    <verse num="12">And I watched when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake took place, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood,</verse>
    <verse num="13">and the stars of heaven<note>Or "of the sky"</note> fell to the earth like a fig tree throws down its unripe figs <transChange type="added">when</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("shaken") which is understood as temporal</note> shaken by a great wind.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the sky was split apart like a scroll that is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved from their place.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the kings of the earth, and the most important people, and the military leaders, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,</verse>
    <verse num="16">And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,</verse>
    <verse num="17">because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?" </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind could blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And I saw another angel ascending {from the east}<note>Literally "from the rising of the sun"</note>, holding the seal of the living God, and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels {who were given permission}<note>Literally "to whom was granted to them"</note> to damage the earth and the sea,</verse>
    <verse num="3">saying, "Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the slaves of our God on their foreheads."</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I heard the number of the ones who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel: </verse>
    <verse num="5">from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed, </verse>

    <verse num="8">from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand, </verse>
    <verse num="9">After these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> I looked, and behold, a great crowd that no one was able to number, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed <transChange type="added">in</transChange> white robes and <transChange type="added">with</transChange> palm branches in their hands.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And they were crying out with a loud voice, saying, </verse>

    <verse num="14">And I said to him, "My lord, you know." And he said to me, </verse>
    <verse num="15">Because of this, they are before the throne of God, and they serve<note>Or "worship"</note> him day and night in his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne {will shelter}<note>Literally "will take up residence over"</note> them.</verse>

    <verse num="1">And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven <transChange type="added">for</transChange> about half an hour.</verse>

    <verse num="3">And another angel who had a golden censer came and stood at the altar, and a large amount of incense was given to him, in order that he could offer the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> before the throne.</verse>

    <verse num="5">And the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire from the altar and threw <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to the earth, and there were thunders and sounds and lightnings and an earthquake. </verse>
    <verse num="6">And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves in order to blow them. </verse>
    <verse num="7">And the first blew the trumpet, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was thrown to the earth, and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. </verse>
    <verse num="8">And the second angel blew the trumpet, and <transChange type="added">something</transChange> like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood,</verse>
    <verse num="9">and a third of the creatures in the sea--the ones which had life--died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. </verse>
    <verse num="10">And the third angel blew the trumpet, and a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the name of the star was called Wormwood, and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the waters because they were made bitter. </verse>
    <verse num="12">And the fourth angel blew the trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened, and the day did not shine <transChange type="added">with respect to</transChange> a third of it, and the night likewise. </verse>
    <verse num="13">And I looked, and I heard one eagle flying {directly overhead}<note>Literally "in midheaven," i.e., "at the zenith"</note>, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who live on the earth, from the remaining sounds of the trumpets of the three angels who are about to blow the trumpet!" </verse>
