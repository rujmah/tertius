    <verse num="1"><transChange type="added">There</transChange> was a man in the land of Uz whose<note>Hebrew "his"</note> name <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Job. That<note>Hebrew "And that"</note> man was blameless and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then<note>Hebrew "And"</note> his livestock came to be seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and five hundred pairs<note>Hebrew "pair"</note> of oxen and five hundred female donkeys, and he had very many slaves, and that man was greater than all the people of the east.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And his sons used to go and hold a feast {at each other's house}<note>Literally "at the house of a man," or "at the house of each"</note> on his day, and they would send, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
    <verse num="5">{Then when}<note>Literally "And it would happen that," or "And it would happen when"</note> the days of the feast had run their course, {Job would send},<note>Literally "and Job would send"</note> and he would sanctify them. Thus<note>Hebrew "And"</note> he would arise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings <transChange type="added">according to</transChange> the number of all of them, because Job thought,<note>Or "said"</note> "Perhaps my children have sinned and {cursed}<note>Literally "blessed"-- negative meaning by context</note> God in their heart." This is what Job used to do {all the time}.<note>Or "always"; literally "all the days"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="6">And it happened {one day}<note>Literally "the day"</note> {that}<note>Literally "and"</note> the sons of God<note>Or "the heavenly beings," or "the angels"</note> came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> also came into their midst.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Yahweh said to Satan,<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> "From where have you come?" </verse>
    <verse num="8">So<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Yahweh said to Satan,<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> "Have you {considered}<note>Literally "set your heart"</note> my servant Job? Indeed,<note>Or "For," or "Because"</note> there is no one like him on the earth--a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil." </verse>
    <verse num="9">Then<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Satan<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> answered Yahweh and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
    <verse num="10">Have you<note>Emphatic personal pronoun could be translated "you yourself"</note> not put a fence around him and his household and around {all that belongs to him}<note>Literally "all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his"</note> {on every side}?<note>Literally "from around"</note> You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock<note>Or "possessions"</note> has increased in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But,<note>Hebrew "And"</note> on the other hand, stretch out<note>Or "please"</note> your hand and touch {all that belongs to him}<note>Literally "all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his"</note> <transChange type="added">and see</transChange> {whether}<note>Literally "if not"</note> he will {curse}<note>Literally "bless"-- negative meaning by context</note> you to your face." </verse>
    <verse num="12">So<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Yahweh said to Satan,<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> "Look, {all that belongs to him}<note>Literally "all that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his"</note> is in your {power}.<note>Literally "hand"</note> Only do not stretch out your hand {against}<note>Literally "to," or "unto"</note> him." So<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Satan<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> went out from Yahweh's {presence}.<note>Literally "faces of"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="13">And then <transChange type="added">there</transChange> was one day when<note>Hebrew "and"</note> his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother's house.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing, and the female donkeys were feeding {beside them}.<note>Literally "on their hands"</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">Then<note>Hebrew "And"</note> the Sabeans {attacked},<note>Literally "fell <transChange type="added">upon them</transChange>"</note> and they took them, and they slew the servants {by the edge of the sword}.<note>Literally "with the mouth of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sword"</note> But<note>Hebrew "And"</note> I escaped, <transChange type="added">even</transChange> I alone, to tell you." </verse>
    <verse num="16">While this one was still speaking, {another}<note>Literally "this"</note> came and said, "The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it blazed up against the sheep and goats and against the servants, and it consumed them. But I escaped, <transChange type="added">even</transChange> I alone, to tell you." </verse>
    <verse num="17">While this one was still speaking, {another}<note>Literally "this"</note> came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three divisions, and they made a raid on the camels, and they carried them away, and they struck your servants {by the edge of the sword},<note>Literally "with the mouth of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sword"</note> but I escaped, <transChange type="added">even</transChange> I alone, to tell you." </verse>
    <verse num="18">At the time<note>Hebrew "Until"</note> this one was speaking, {another}<note>Literally "this"</note> came and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother's house.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And behold,<note>Or "Look"</note> a great wind came from across the desert, and it struck the four corners of the house {so that}<note>Literally "and"</note> it fell upon the young people, and they died. But I escaped, <transChange type="added">even</transChange> I alone, to tell you." </verse>
    <verse num="20">Then<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Job arose and tore his outer garment<note>Or "robe"</note> and shaved his head; {then}<note>Hebrew "and"</note> he fell upon the ground and he worshiped.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then<note>Hebrew "And"</note> he said, "Naked I came out from my mother's womb, and naked I will return there. Yahweh gives, and Yahweh takes. Let Yahweh's name be blessed."</verse>
    <verse num="22">In all this, Job did not sin and did not {charge God with wrongdoing}.<note>Literally "give unseemliness to God"</note> </verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">{And then}<note>Literally "And it came to be," or "and it happened"</note> one day the sons of God<note>Or "the heavenly beings," or "the angels"</note> came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> also came into their midst to present himself before Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Yahweh {asked}<note>Literally "said to"</note> Satan,<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> "From where have you come?" </verse>

    <verse num="4">Then<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Satan<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> answered him and said, "Skin for skin! All that {that}<note>Literally "the"</note> man has he will give for his life.</verse>

    <verse num="7">So<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Satan<note>Hebrew "the accuser," or "the adversary"</note> went out from {Yahweh's presence},<note>Literally "the faces of Yahweh"</note> and he inflicted Job with loathsome skin sores from the sole of his foot up to the crown of his head.</verse>
    <verse num="8">{So}<note>Hebrew "And"</note> he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat in the midst of the ashes. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Then<note>Hebrew "And"</note> his wife said to him, "Are you still persisting in your blamelessness? {Curse}<note>Literally "Bless"--negative meaning by context</note> God and die." </verse>
    <verse num="10">So<note>Hebrew "And"</note> he said to her, "You speak like one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we receive the good from God, but<note>Or "and"</note> not receive the evil?" In all this, Job did not sin with his lips. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Thus<note>Hebrew "And"</note> Job's three friends heard of this calamity that had come upon him.

    <verse num="12">Thus<note>Hebrew "And"</note> they lifted up their eyes<note>Or "they gazed"</note> from afar, but<note>Hebrew "and"</note> they did not recognize him, so<note>Hebrew "and"</note> they raised their voice, and they wept, and each man tore his outer garment<note>Or "robe"</note> and threw dust on their heads {toward the sky}.<note>Or "in the air"; literally "to the heavens"</note></verse>
    <verse num="13">Then<note>Hebrew "And"</note> they sat with him on the ground <transChange type="added">for</transChange> seven days and seven nights, but<note>Hebrew "and"</note> no one spoke<note>Or "there was no speaking"</note> a word to him because they saw that {his}<note>Literally "the"</note> suffering was very great. </verse>
