    <verse num="1">Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace. </verse>
    <verse num="2">We give thanks to God always concerning all of you, making mention constantly in our prayers,</verse>
    <verse num="3"><transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("remember") which is understood as causal</note> remember your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father,</verse>
    <verse num="4">knowing, brothers <transChange type="added">dearly</transChange> loved by God, {that he has chosen you}<note>Literally "the choice of you"</note>,</verse>
    <verse num="5">because our gospel did not come to you with word only, but also with power and with the Holy Spirit and with much certainty, just as you know what sort of <transChange type="added">people</transChange> we became among you for your sake.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
    <verse num="7">so that you became an example to all those who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia,</verse>
    <verse num="8">for from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia,<note>Some manuscripts have "and in Achaia"</note> but in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we have no need to say anything.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For <transChange type="added">they</transChange> themselves report about us, what sort of welcome we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve <transChange type="added">the</transChange> living and true God,</verse>
    <verse num="10">and to await his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, the one who delivers us from the coming wrath. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">For <transChange type="added">you</transChange> yourselves know, brothers, our reception with you, that it was not in vain,</verse>
    <verse num="2">but <transChange type="added">after we</transChange> had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, just as you know, we had the courage in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For our exhortation <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not from error or from impurity or with deceit,</verse>
    <verse num="4">but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, thus we speak, not as pleasing people but God, who examines our hearts.</verse>
    <verse num="5">{For never}<note>Literally "for neither ever"</note> did we come with a word of flattery, just as you know, nor with a pretext of greediness (God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> witness),</verse>
    <verse num="6">nor seeking glory from people, neither from you nor from others.</verse>
    <verse num="7">{Although we could have insisted on our own importance}<note>Literally "being able to be with a claim of importance"</note><note>*Here the participle ("being able") is understood as concessive</note> as apostles of Christ, yet we became infants in your midst, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Longing for you in this way, we determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls, because you had become dear to us. </verse>
    <verse num="9">For you remember, brothers, our labor and hardship: working by night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</verse>
    <verse num="10">You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> witnesses, and <transChange type="added">so is</transChange> God, how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we became to you who believe,</verse>
    <verse num="11">just as you know how <transChange type="added">we treated</transChange> each one of you, like a father his own children,</verse>
    <verse num="12">exhorting and consoling you and insisting that you live in a manner worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory. </verse>
    <verse num="13">And because of this we also give thanks to God constantly, that <transChange type="added">when you</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("received") which is understood as temporal</note> received God's word {that you heard}<note>Literally "of hearing"</note> from us, you accepted <transChange type="added">it</transChange> not <transChange type="added">as the</transChange> word of men, but as <transChange type="added">it</transChange> truly is, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For you became imitators, brothers, of the churches of God <transChange type="added">which</transChange> are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because you also suffered the same <transChange type="added">things</transChange> at the hands of your own people, just as <transChange type="added">they</transChange> themselves <transChange type="added">did</transChange> also at the hands of the Jews,</verse>
    <verse num="15">who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and who persecuted us, and <transChange type="added">who are</transChange> not pleasing to God and <transChange type="added">are</transChange> opposed to all people,</verse>
    <verse num="16">hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles in order that they may be saved, so that <transChange type="added">they</transChange> always fill up their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the end.<note>Or "has come upon them at last"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="17">But <transChange type="added">when</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were made orphans by separation") which is understood as temporal</note> we were made orphans by separation from you, brothers, for {a short time}<note>Literally "the time of an hour"</note> (in face, not in heart), <transChange type="added">we were</transChange> even more eager with great desire to see your face,</verse>
    <verse num="18">because we wanted to come to you--I, Paul, {on more than one occasion}<note>Literally "both once and twice"</note>--and Satan hindered us.</verse>
    <verse num="19">For who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> our hope or joy or crown of boasting? <transChange type="added">Is it</transChange> not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming?</verse>
    <verse num="20">For you are our glory and joy. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Therefore <transChange type="added">when we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("could bear") which is understood as temporal</note> could bear <transChange type="added">it</transChange> no longer, we determined to be left behind in Athens alone,</verse>
    <verse num="2">and we sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, in order to strengthen and to encourage you about your faith,</verse>
    <verse num="3"><transChange type="added">so that</transChange> no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For <transChange type="added">you</transChange> yourselves know that we are appointed for this,</verse>
    <verse num="4">for indeed when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were about to be afflicted, just as indeed it happened, and you know.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Because of this, I also, <transChange type="added">when I</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("could endure") which is understood as temporal</note> could endure <transChange type="added">it</transChange> no longer, sent in order to know your faith, lest somehow the tempter tempted you and our labor should be in vain. </verse>
    <verse num="6">But now, <transChange type="added">because</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has come") which is understood as causal</note> Timothy has come to us from you and has brought good news to us of your faith and love, and that {you always think kindly of us}<note>Literally "that you have kindly remembrance of us always"</note>, desiring to see us just as also we <transChange type="added">desire to see</transChange> you,</verse>
    <verse num="7">because of this, brothers, we have been comforted because of you in all our distress and affliction through your faith,</verse>
    <verse num="8">because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For what thanks can we repay to God concerning you, because of all the joy <transChange type="added">with</transChange> which we rejoice because of you before our God,</verse>
    <verse num="10">night and day praying beyond all measure that <transChange type="added">we</transChange> may see your face and complete what is lacking in your faith? </verse>
    <verse num="11">Now <transChange type="added">may</transChange> our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you,</verse>
    <verse num="12">and <transChange type="added">may</transChange> the Lord <transChange type="added">cause</transChange> you to increase and to abound in love for one another and for all, just as also we <transChange type="added">do</transChange> for you,</verse>
    <verse num="13">so that your hearts may be established blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.<note>Some manuscripts have "his saints. Amen."</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Finally therefore, brothers, we ask you and appeal to <transChange type="added">you</transChange> in the Lord Jesus that, just as you have received from us how it is necessary for you to live and to please God, just as indeed you are living, that you progress even more.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For you know what commands we gave to you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For this is the will of God, your sanctification: <transChange type="added">that</transChange> you abstain from sexual immorality;</verse>
    <verse num="4"><transChange type="added">that</transChange> each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</verse>
    <verse num="5">not in lustful passion, just as also the Gentiles who do not know God;</verse>
    <verse num="6">not to transgress and to exploit his brother in the matter, because the Lord <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the one who avenges concerning all these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, just as also we told you beforehand and testified solemnly.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For God did not call us to impurity, but in holiness.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Therefore the one who rejects <transChange type="added">this</transChange> <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not rejecting man, but God, <transChange type="added">who</transChange> also gives his Holy Spirit to you. </verse>
    <verse num="9">But concerning brotherly love, I do not have need to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,</verse>
    <verse num="10">for indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to progress even more,</verse>
    <verse num="11">and to aspire to live a quiet life, and to attend to {your own business},<note>Literally "your own things"</note> and to work with your hands,<note>Some manuscripts have "your own hands"</note> just as we commanded you,</verse>
    <verse num="12">so that you may live decently toward those outside, and may have need of nothing. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Now we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you will not grieve as also the rest, who have no hope.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose <transChange type="added">again</transChange>, thus also God will bring those who have fallen asleep through Jesus together with him.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain until the Lord's coming, will not possibly precede those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then we who are alive, who remain, will be snatched away at the same time together with them in the clouds for a meeting with the Lord in the air, and thus we will be together with the Lord always.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Therefore comfort one another with these words. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need <transChange type="added">of anything</transChange> to be written to you,</verse>
    <verse num="2">for <transChange type="added">you</transChange> yourselves well know that the day of the Lord is coming in the <transChange type="added">same</transChange> way as a thief in the night.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Whenever they say "Peace and security," then sudden destruction will overtake them like the birth pains of {a pregnant woman}<note>Literally "one who has in the belly"</note>, and they will not possibly escape.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But you, brothers, are not in the darkness, so that the day should catch you like a thief,</verse>
    <verse num="5">for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. </verse>
    <verse num="6">So then, we must not sleep like the rest, but must be on the alert and be self-controlled.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But <transChange type="added">because</transChange><note>Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as causal</note> we are of the day, we must be sober, <transChange type="added">by</transChange><note>Here "<transChange type="added">by</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("putting on") which is understood as means</note> putting on the breastplate of faith and love and <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a helmet the hope of salvation,</verse>
    <verse num="9">because God did not appoint us for wrath, but for the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="10">who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live at the same time with him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Therefore encourage one another and build up {each other}<note>Literally "one the one," i.e., "one the other"</note>, just as indeed you are doing. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and rule over you in the Lord and admonish you,</verse>
    <verse num="13">and to esteem them beyond all measure in love, because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. </verse>
    <verse num="14">And we urge you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, console the discouraged, help the sick, be patient toward all <transChange type="added">people</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="15">See to it that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue good toward<note>Some manuscripts have "both toward"</note> one another and toward all <transChange type="added">people</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="16">Rejoice always,</verse>
    <verse num="17">pray constantly,</verse>
    <verse num="18">give thanks in everything; for this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Do not despise prophecies,</verse>
    <verse num="21">but examine all <transChange type="added">things</transChange>; hold fast to <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> good.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete, blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="24">The one who calls you <transChange type="added">is</transChange> faithful, who also will do <transChange type="added">this</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="25">Brothers, pray for us.<note>Some manuscripts have "pray for us also"</note></verse>
    <verse num="26">Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
    <verse num="27">I adjure you by the Lord, have this letter read aloud to all the brothers.</verse>
    <verse num="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <transChange type="added">be</transChange> with you. </verse>
