    <verse num="4">If Edom says, "We are shattered, but we will return and rebuild <transChange type="added">the</transChange> ruins," Yahweh of hosts says this: "They may build, but I will tear down; and they will be called a territory of wickedness, and the people <transChange type="added">with</transChange> whom Yahweh is angry forever."</verse>
    <verse num="5">Your eyes will see <transChange type="added">this</transChange>, and you will say, "Yahweh is great beyond the borders<note>Hebrew "boundary"</note> of Israel." </verse>
    <verse num="6">"A son honors <transChange type="added">his</transChange> father, and a slave his master;<note>Hebrew "masters"</note> but if I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> a father, where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my honor, and if I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> a master,<note>Hebrew "masters"</note> where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my reverence?" says Yahweh of hosts to you, O priests, {who despise}<note>Literally "despisers of"</note> my name. "But you say, 'How have we despised your name?'</verse>
    <verse num="7"><transChange type="added">You are</transChange> presenting defiled food on my altar! But you ask, 'How have we defiled you?' By saying <transChange type="added">that</transChange> the table of Yahweh is despised!</verse>
    <verse num="8">When you offer a blind <transChange type="added">animal</transChange> for sacrifice, is that not wrong?<note>Or "is there no wrong?"</note> And when you offer <transChange type="added">the</transChange> lame and the one who is ill, is that not wrong?<note>Or "is there no wrong?"</note> Present it, please, to your governor!

    <verse num="11">From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name <transChange type="added">is</transChange> great among the nations, and in every place incense <transChange type="added">is</transChange> being presented to my name, and a pure offering.

    <verse num="12">"But you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> profaning it by saying the table of the Lord <transChange type="added">is</transChange> defiled, and its fruit--its food<note>The Hebrew here is difficult; "its food" may function to explain "its fruit"</note>--is despised!</verse>
    <verse num="13">And you say, 'Look! <transChange type="added">This is</transChange> a weariness,' and you sniff <transChange type="added">with disdain</transChange> at it," says Yahweh of hosts. "And you bring <transChange type="added">the</transChange> stolen, the lame, and the one that is sick--<transChange type="added">this</transChange> you bring as the offering! Should I {accept it}<note>Literally "take pleasure in it"</note> from your hand?" says Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="14">"Cursed is the one who cheats, who has in his flock a male and vows <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, but <transChange type="added">instead</transChange> sacrifices a blemished one to the Lord!

    <verse num="1">"And so then, O priests, this command <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for you:</verse>

The subject is indefinite, and "it" likely refers to a refuse or waste pile</note> </verse>
    <verse num="4">"Then you will know that I have sent to you this command, that my covenant with Levi {continues},"<note>Literally "be"</note> says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="5">"My covenant with him was <transChange type="added">one of</transChange> life and peace, and I gave them to him. <transChange type="added">This required</transChange> reverence, and he revered<note>Or "feared"</note> me and stood in awe {before}<note>Literally "from the face of"</note> my name.</verse>
    <verse num="6"><transChange type="added">The</transChange> instruction of truth<note>Or "law of truth"</note> was in his mouth, and wickedness was not found on his lips.

    <verse num="7">For the lips of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> priest should guard knowledge, and they should seek instruction<note>Or "law"</note> from his mouth, for he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the messenger of Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But you, you have turned from the way; you have caused many to stumble by <transChange type="added">your</transChange> instruction;<note>Or "<transChange type="added">the</transChange> law"</note> you have ruined the covenant of Levi," says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="9">"And in turn I have made you despised and humbled before all the people, inasmuch as you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> not keeping<note>Or "observing"</note> my way, but are {favoring your own instruction}."<note>Literally "lifting faces in the instruction/law"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="10">{Do we not all have}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> for all of us not"</note> one father? Has not one God created us?

    <verse num="11">Judah has been faithless, and a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. Judah has profaned the sanctuary of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign<note>Or "pagan"</note> god.</verse>
    <verse num="12">May Yahweh cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who does this, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> one who is awake and <transChange type="added">who</transChange> answers, and <transChange type="added">the one who</transChange> brings an offering to Yahweh of hosts! </verse>
    <verse num="13">And this you do {as well}:<note>Literally "a second time"</note> <transChange type="added">you</transChange> cover the altar of Yahweh <transChange type="added">with</transChange> tears, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> weeping and <transChange type="added">with</transChange> groaning, because he<note>Yahweh</note> {no longer regards the offering}<note>Literally "there is no longer turning to the offering"</note> or accepts <transChange type="added">it</transChange> <transChange type="added">with</transChange> favor from your hand.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But you ask, "{For what reason}?"<note>Literally "Because of what?"</note> Because Yahweh stands as a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have been unfaithful, even though she <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your marriage partner and {your wife by covenant}.<note>Literally "the wife of your covenant"</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">{Did not one God make them?}<note>Literally "Not one did he make"</note> But a remnant of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> spirit is his.<note>The meaning of this sentence is difficult; literally "And a remnant of the spirit to him"</note> And what does the one <transChange type="added">God</transChange> desire?

    <verse num="4">And the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to Yahweh, like <transChange type="added">in the</transChange> days of old and like <transChange type="added">in</transChange> former years. </verse>
