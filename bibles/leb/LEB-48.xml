  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">Paul, an apostle not from men nor by men but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead,</verse>
    <verse num="2">and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,<note>Some manuscripts have "God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">who gave himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
    <verse num="5">to whom <transChange type="added">be</transChange> the glory forever and ever. Amen. </verse>
    <verse num="6">I am astonished that you are turning away so quickly from the one who called you by the grace of Christ to a different gospel,</verse>
    <verse num="7">not that <transChange type="added">there</transChange> is a different <transChange type="added">gospel</transChange>, except there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim a gospel to you contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let him be accursed!</verse>
    <verse num="9">As we said before, and now I say again, if anyone is proclaiming a gospel <transChange type="added">to</transChange> you contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed!</verse>
    <verse num="10">For am I now making an appeal to people or <transChange type="added">to</transChange> God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ. </verse>
    <verse num="11">For I make known to you, brothers, the gospel that has been proclaimed by me, that it is not {of human origin}<note>Literally "according to man"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, but <transChange type="added">I received it</transChange> through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism, that to an extraordinary degree I was persecuting the church of God, and trying to destroy it,</verse>
    <verse num="14">and was progressing in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my nation, <transChange type="added">because</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as causal</note> I was a far more zealous adherent of the traditions handed down by my forefathers. </verse>
    <verse num="15">But when the one who set me apart<note>Some manuscripts have "when God who set me apart"</note> from my mother's womb and called <transChange type="added">me</transChange> by his grace was pleased</verse>
    <verse num="16">to reveal his Son in me in order that I would proclaim the gospel <transChange type="added">about</transChange> him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood,</verse>
    <verse num="17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and I returned again to Damascus.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days,</verse>
    <verse num="19">but I did not see <transChange type="added">any</transChange> others of the apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="20">(Now <transChange type="added">the things</transChange> which I am writing to you, behold, <transChange type="added">I assure you</transChange> before God that I am not lying.)</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,</verse>
    <verse num="22">but I was unknown {in person}<note>Literally "by face"</note> to the churches of Judea <transChange type="added">that are</transChange> in Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="23">and they were only hearing, "The one formerly persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith that formerly he was attempting to destroy,"</verse>
    <verse num="24">and they were glorifying God because of me. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking along Titus also.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now I went up <transChange type="added">there</transChange> because of a revelation and laid out to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but in private to the influential people, lest somehow I was running, or had run, in vain.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But not even Titus <transChange type="added">who was</transChange> with me, <transChange type="added">although</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as concessive</note> he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Now <transChange type="added">this was</transChange> because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order that they might enslave us,</verse>
    <verse num="5">to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection, in order that the truth of the gospel might remain continually with you.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But from those {who were influential}<note>Literally "who were thought to be something"</note> (whatever they were, <transChange type="added">it makes</transChange> no difference to me, {God does not show partiality}<note>Literally "God does not receive the face of man"</note>)--for those who were influential added nothing to me.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But these, <transChange type="added">when they</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("saw") which is understood as temporal</note> saw that I had been entrusted <transChange type="added">with</transChange> the gospel to the uncircumcision, just as Peter to the circumcision</verse>
    <verse num="8">(for the one who was at work through Peter for <transChange type="added">his</transChange> apostleship to the circumcision was at work also through me for the Gentiles),</verse>
    <verse num="9">and <transChange type="added">when</transChange> James and Cephas and John--those thought to be pillars--acknowledged the grace given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right <transChange type="added">hand</transChange> of fellowship, in order that we <transChange type="added">should go</transChange> to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision.</verse>
    <verse num="10"><transChange type="added">They asked</transChange> only that we should remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do. </verse>
    <verse num="11">But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed <transChange type="added">him</transChange> to his face, because he was condemned.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For before certain people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles, but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, <transChange type="added">because he</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was afraid of") which is understood as causal</note> was afraid of those <transChange type="added">who were</transChange> of the circumcision,</verse>
    <verse num="13">and the rest of the Jews also joined in <transChange type="added">this</transChange> hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with them in <transChange type="added">their</transChange> hypocrisy.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But when I saw that they were not being straightforward with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of <transChange type="added">them</transChange> all, "If you, <transChange type="added">although you</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as concessive</note> are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you try to compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?" </verse>
    <verse num="15">We <transChange type="added">are</transChange> Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles,</verse>
    <verse num="16">but knowing that a person is not justified by the works of the law, if not by faith in Jesus Christ,<note>Or "by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ"</note> and we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we may be justified by faith in Christ<note>Or "by the faithfulness of Christ"</note> and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law {no human being will be justified}<note>Literally "all flesh will not be justified"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But if <transChange type="added">while</transChange> seeking to be justified by Christ, <transChange type="added">we</transChange> ourselves also have been found <transChange type="added">to be</transChange> sinners, then <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Christ an agent of sin? May it never be!</verse>
    <verse num="18">For if I build up again these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> which I destroyed, I show myself <transChange type="added">to be</transChange> a transgressor.</verse>
    <verse num="19">For through the law I died to the law, in order that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="20">and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, and that <transChange type="added">life</transChange> I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
    <verse num="21">I do not declare invalid the grace of God, for if righteousness <transChange type="added">is</transChange> through the law, then Christ died to no purpose. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed <transChange type="added">as</transChange> having been crucified?</verse>
    <verse num="2">I want only to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
    <verse num="3">Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now trying to be made complete by the flesh?</verse>
    <verse num="4">Have you suffered so many <transChange type="added">things</transChange> for nothing--if indeed also <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> for nothing?</verse>
    <verse num="5">Therefore does the one who gives you the Spirit and who works miracles among you <transChange type="added">do so</transChange> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? </verse>
    <verse num="6">Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,</verse>
    <verse num="7">then understand that the ones {who have faith}<note>Literally "of faith"</note>, these are sons of Abraham.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham: "In you all the nations<note>Or "Gentiles"; the same Greek word can be translated "nations" or "Gentiles" depending on the context</note> will be blessed."<note>A quotation from Gen 12:3; 18:18</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">So then, the ones <transChange type="added">who have</transChange> faith are blessed together with Abraham who believed.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written, "Cursed <transChange type="added">is</transChange> everyone who does not abide by all <transChange type="added">the things</transChange> that are written in the book of the law to do them."<note>A quotation from Deut 27:26</note></verse>
    <verse num="11">Now <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> clear that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law, because "the one who is righteous will live by faith."<note>Or "the one who is righteous by faith will live," a quotation from Hab 2:4</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">But the law is not from faith, but "the one who does these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> will live by them."<note>A quotation from Lev 18:5</note> </verse>
    <verse num="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law <transChange type="added">by</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">by</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("becoming") which is understood as means</note> becoming a curse for us, because it is written, "Cursed <transChange type="added">is</transChange> everyone who hangs on a tree,"<note>A quotation from Deut 21:23</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. </verse>
    <verse num="15">Brothers, I am speaking according to a human perspective. Nevertheless, <transChange type="added">when</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has been ratified") which is understood as temporal</note> the covenant of a man has been ratified, no one declares <transChange type="added">it</transChange> invalid or adds additional provisions <transChange type="added">to it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Now to Abraham and to his descendant the promises were spoken. It does not say, "and to descendants," as concerning many, but as concerning one, "and to your descendant,"<note>A quotation from Gen 12:7; 13:15; 17:7; 24:7</note> who is Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Now I am saying this: the law, that came after four hundred and thirty years, does not revoke a covenant previously ratified by God, in order to nullify the promise.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For if the inheritance <transChange type="added">is</transChange> from the law, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> no longer from the promise, but God graciously gave <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to Abraham through the promise. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Why then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, until the descendant should come to whom it had been promised, having been ordered through angels by the hand of a mediator.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Now the mediator is not for one, but God is one. </verse>
    <verse num="21">Therefore <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the law opposed to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, certainly righteousness would have been from the law.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But the scripture imprisoned all under sin, in order that the promise could be given by faith<note>Or "through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ"</note> in Jesus Christ to those who believe. </verse>
    <verse num="23">But before faith came, we were detained under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed.</verse>
    <verse num="24">So then, the law became our guardian until Christ, in order that we could be justified by faith.</verse>
    <verse num="25">But <transChange type="added">after</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">after</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has come") which is understood as temporal</note> faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.</verse>
    <verse num="26">For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,<note>Or "For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith"</note></verse>
    <verse num="27">for as many <transChange type="added">of you</transChange> as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And if you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> Christ's, then you are descendants of Abraham, heirs according to the promise. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Now I say, for as long a time <transChange type="added">as</transChange> the heir is a child, <transChange type="added">he is</transChange> no different from a slave, <transChange type="added">although he</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as concessive</note> is master of everything,</verse>
    <verse num="2">but he is under guardians and managers until the time set by <transChange type="added">his</transChange> father.</verse>
    <verse num="3">So also we, when we were children, we were enslaved under the elemental spirits of the world.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But when the fullness of time came, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
    <verse num="5">in order that he might redeem those under the law, in order that we might receive the adoption.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And because you are sons, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out, "Abba!<note>"Abba" is Aramaic for "father"</note> (Father!),"</verse>
    <verse num="7">so that you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, also an heir through God. </verse>
    <verse num="8">But at that time <transChange type="added">when you</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as temporal</note> did not know God, you were enslaved to the things which by nature are not gods.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But now, <transChange type="added">because you</transChange> have come to know God, or rather have come to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental spirits? Do you want to be enslaved to them<note>Literally "to whom"</note> all over again?</verse>
    <verse num="10">You carefully observe days and months and seasons and years.</verse>
    <verse num="11">I am afraid <transChange type="added">for</transChange> you, lest perhaps I have labored for you in vain!</verse>
    <verse num="12">I ask you, brothers, become like me, because I also <transChange type="added">have become</transChange> like you. You have done me no <transChange type="added">wrong</transChange>! </verse>
    <verse num="13">But you know that because of an illness of the flesh I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And you did not despise or disdain <transChange type="added">what was</transChange> a trial for you in my flesh, but you welcomed me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your blessing? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes <transChange type="added">and</transChange> given <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to me!</verse>
    <verse num="16">So then, have I become your enemy <transChange type="added">by</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">by</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("being truthful") which is understood as means</note> being truthful to you?</verse>
    <verse num="17">They zealously seek you, not commendably, but they want to exclude you, in order that you may seek them <transChange type="added">zealously</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="18">But <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> good to be sought zealously in good at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
    <verse num="19">My children, for whom I am having birth pains again, until Christ is formed in you!</verse>
    <verse num="20">But I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone because I am perplexed about you. </verse>
    <verse num="21">Tell me, <transChange type="added">you</transChange> who are wanting to be under the law, do you not understand<note>Literally "hear"</note> the law?</verse>
    <verse num="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the female slave and one by the free woman.</verse>
    <verse num="23">But the one by the female slave was born according to human descent, and the one by the free woman through the promise,</verse>
    <verse num="24">which <transChange type="added">things</transChange> are spoken allegorically, for these <transChange type="added">women</transChange> are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing <transChange type="added">children</transChange> for slavery, who is Hagar.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is a slave with her children.</verse>
    <verse num="26">But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</verse>
    <verse num="27">For it is written, </verse>
    <verse num="28">But you, brothers, are children of the promise, just as Isaac.</verse>
    <verse num="29">But just as at that time the <transChange type="added">child</transChange> born according to human descent persecuted the <transChange type="added">child born</transChange> according to the Spirit, so also now.</verse>
    <verse num="30">But what does the scripture say? "Drive out the female slave and her son, for the son of the female slave will never inherit with the son"<note>A quotation from Gen 21:10, which does not include the words "of the free woman"</note> of the free woman.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the female slave but of the free woman. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Look! I, Paul, tell you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing!</verse>
    <verse num="3">And again I testify to every man who becomes circumcised, that he is under obligation to keep the whole law.</verse>
    <verse num="4">You are estranged from Christ, <transChange type="added">you</transChange> who are attempting to be justified<note>*The present tense has been translated as conative here ("are attempting")</note> by the law; you have fallen from grace.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For through the Spirit by faith we eagerly await the hope of righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love. </verse>
    <verse num="7">You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</verse>
    <verse num="8">This persuasion <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not from the one who calls you!</verse>
    <verse num="9">A little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough.</verse>
    <verse num="10">I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will think nothing different, but the one who is confusing you {will pay the penalty}<note>Literally "will bear the <transChange type="added">= his</transChange> condemnation"</note>, whoever he may be.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Now, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.</verse>
    <verse num="12">I wish that the ones who are disturbing you would also {castrate themselves}<note>Literally "cut themselves off"</note>! </verse>
    <verse num="13">For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not let your freedom <transChange type="added">become</transChange> an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement, namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."<note>A quotation from Lev 19:18</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">But if you bite and devour one another, watch out <transChange type="added">that</transChange> you are not consumed by one another. </verse>
    <verse num="16">But I say, live by the Spirit, and you will never carry out the desire of the flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, for these are in opposition to one another, so that whatever you want, you may not do these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. </verse>
    <verse num="19">Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are sexual immorality, impurity, licentiousness,</verse>
    <verse num="20">idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, factions,</verse>
    <verse num="21">envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, <transChange type="added">things</transChange> which I am telling you <transChange type="added">in advance</transChange>, just as I said before, that the ones who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
    <verse num="23">gentleness, self control. Against such things <transChange type="added">there</transChange> is no law.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Now those {who belong to Christ}<note>Literally "of Christ"</note><note>Some manuscripts have "Christ Jesus"</note> have crucified the flesh together with its feelings and its desires. </verse>
    <verse num="25">If we live by the Spirit, we must also follow the Spirit.</verse>
    <verse num="26">We must not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Brothers, even if a person is caught in some trespass, you <transChange type="added">who are</transChange> spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of humility, looking out for yourself, lest you also be tempted.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Carry the burdens of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For if anyone thinks he is something <transChange type="added">although he</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as concessive</note> is nothing, he is deceiving himself.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in someone else.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For each one will carry his own burden. </verse>
    <verse num="6">Now the one who is taught the word must share in all good <transChange type="added">things</transChange> with the one who teaches.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked, for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap,</verse>
    <verse num="8">because the one who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap, <transChange type="added">if we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">if</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("give up") which is understood as conditional</note> do not give up.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all <transChange type="added">people</transChange>, and especially to those who belong to the household of faith. </verse>
    <verse num="11">See with what large letters I am writing to you with my <transChange type="added">own</transChange> hand.</verse>
    <verse num="12">As many as are wanting to make a good showing in the flesh, these are attempting to compel<note>*The present tense has been translated as conative here ("are attempting")</note> you to be circumcised, only so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For not even those who are circumcised observe the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised in order that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But <transChange type="added">as</transChange> for me, may it never be <transChange type="added">that I</transChange> boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And all those who follow this rule, peace and mercy <transChange type="added">be</transChange> on them and on the Israel of God. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I carry on my body the marks of Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <transChange type="added">be</transChange> with your spirit, brothers. Amen. </verse>
