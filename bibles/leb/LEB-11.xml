  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">Now King David had become old, {advanced in years},<note>Literally "he went in the days"</note> and they covered him with garments, but he was not warm.</verse>
    <verse num="2">His servants said to him, "Let them search for a young virgin for my lord the king, and let her stand before the king. Let her be of use for him, and let her lie in your lap that my lord the king may be warm."</verse>
    <verse num="3">So they sought a beautiful young woman in all the territory of Israel, and they found Abishag the Shunnamite and brought her to the king.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Now the young woman was very beautiful; she was of use for the king, and she served him, but the king did not {have sexual relations with her}.<note>Literally "know her"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="5">Now Adonijah the son of Haggith was exalting himself, saying, "I will be king," so he prepared for himself a chariot and horsemen and fifty men running before him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">His father did not rebuke him {at any time}<note>Literally "from his days"</note> <transChange type="added">by</transChange> saying, "Why did you do so?" Now he was also very handsome of appearance; she had borne him after Absalom.<note>"She" refers to Haggith bearing Adonijah; Absalom's mother was Maacah</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">{He conferred}<note>Literally "And there were his words"</note> with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and {they supported Adonijah}.<note>Literally "they helped after Adonijah"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty warriors were David's; they were not with Adonijah. </verse>
    <verse num="9">And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened animals near the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel. He invited all of his brothers, the sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty warriors or Solomon his brother. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, "Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, but our lord David does not know?</verse>
    <verse num="12">So then, come, let me advise you please, {that you may save}<note>Literally "and save"</note> your life and the life of your son, Solomon.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Come, go to King David and say to him, 'Have you not, my lord the king, sworn to your servant, "Surely Solomon your son shall become king after me. And he will sit on my throne"? But why is Adonijah king?'</verse>
    <verse num="14">While you are still there speaking with the king, I will enter after you, and {I will confirm your words}."<note>Literally "I will make full your words"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="15">So Bathsheba went to the king in the private room. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunnamite was attending the king.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Bathsheba knelt and bowed down before the king, and the king asked, "{What do you want}?"<note>Literally "What <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for you"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">She said to him, "My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your servant, 'Solomon your son surely shall become king after me, and he will sit upon my throne!'</verse>
    <verse num="18">But now, look! Adonijah has become king! And now, my lord the king, you do not know!</verse>
    <verse num="19">He has sacrificed oxen and sheep and fattened animals {in abundance},<note>Literally "as far as the many"</note> and he has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, Joab the commander of the army, but Solomon your servant he did not invite.</verse>
    <verse num="20">But as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all of Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">It shall be that when my lord the king sleeps with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> I and my son Solomon will be <transChange type="added">considered as</transChange> sinners." </verse>
    <verse num="22">While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came <transChange type="added">in</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="23">They told the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." He came into the presence of the king and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Nathan said, "My lord the king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall be king after me and he shall sit on my throne'? </verse>
    <verse num="25">"For he went down today and sacrificed oxen, sheep, and fattened animals {in abundance}.<note>Literally "as far as the many"</note> He invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest, and look, they are eating and drinking before him. They have also said, "Long live King Adonijah!</verse>
    <verse num="26">But me, your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Solomon your servant he did not invite.</verse>
    <verse num="27">If it was from my lord the king that this thing has happened, <transChange type="added">then all is well,</transChange> but if not, you must let your servants know who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him."</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then King David answered and said, "Summon Bathsheba for me." Then she came before the king and stood in his presence.<note>Following the corrected LXX and Vulgate</note></verse>
    <verse num="29">Then the king swore and said, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> who has saved my life from all trouble,</verse>
    <verse num="30">surely as I swore to you by Yahweh the God of Israel, saying, 'Solomon your son shall surely be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,' surely I shall do so this <transChange type="added">very</transChange> day."</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then Bathsheba knelt with her face to the ground and did obeisance to the king, and she said, "May my lord, King David, live forever." </verse>
    <verse num="32">Then King David said, "Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada," and they came before the king.</verse>
    <verse num="33">The king said to them, "Take with you all the servants of your lord, and let them make Solomon my son ride on my mule, and bring him down to Gihon.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Blow on the trumpet and say, 'Long live King Solomon!'</verse>
    <verse num="35">Then you shall go up after him, and let him come and sit on my throne; he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be leader over Israel and Judah."</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, "Amen! So may Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, confirm it!</verse>
    <verse num="37">As Yahweh was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."</verse>
    <verse num="38">Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites went down, and they let Solomon ride on the mule of King David, and they brought him to Gihon.</verse>
    <verse num="39">Then Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent, and he anointed Solomon. They blew on the trumpet, and all the people said, "Long live King Solomon!"</verse>
    <verse num="40">All the people went up after him, and the people were playing on the flutes and rejoicing <transChange type="added">with</transChange> great joy, and the earth shook with their noise. </verse>
    <verse num="41">And Adonijah and all the invited guests who were with him heard <transChange type="added">it</transChange>. Now they were finished eating when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet and said, "{Why is there such a noise in the city?}"<note>Literally "Why is the sound of the city noisy?"</note></verse>
    <verse num="42">While he was still speaking, suddenly Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Adonijah said, "Come, for you are a man of valor, and you bring good news."</verse>
    <verse num="43">Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, "But our lord King David has made Solomon king!</verse>
    <verse num="44">He sent Zadok the priest with the king, and Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites; they made him ride on the king's mule.</verse>
    <verse num="45">Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing. The city has gone wild; this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the sound which you heard.</verse>
    <verse num="46">And also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom!</verse>
    <verse num="47">The servants of the king also came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'Your God has made the name of Solomon better than your name and his throne greater than your throne!' So the king worshiped on the bed.</verse>
    <verse num="48">What is more, the king said, 'May Yahweh the God of Israel be blessed, who has given this day one sitting on my throne, and my eyes are seeing <transChange type="added">it</transChange>!'" </verse>
    <verse num="49">Then all the invited guests who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> for Adonijah trembled and got up and went, each on his way.</verse>
    <verse num="50">Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon, and he got up and went and grasped the horns of the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="51">Solomon was told, "Look, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, and he has grasped the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me {first}<note>Literally "as the day"</note> that he will surely not kill his servant with the sword!'"</verse>
    <verse num="52">Solomon said, "If he is a son of noble character, not a hair of his <transChange type="added">head</transChange> will fall to the ground, but if evil is found in him, then he will die."</verse>
    <verse num="53">Then King Solomon sent and brought him down from upon the altar. He came and did obeisance to King Solomon. Solomon said to him, "Go to your house." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">The days of David came near <transChange type="added">for him</transChange> to die, and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">"I <transChange type="added">am about to</transChange> go the way of all the world. Be strong and be {courageous}.<note>Literally "as a man"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">You shall keep the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, his judgments, and his testimonies, as are written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and everywhere you turn,</verse>
    <verse num="4">so that Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your sons take heed of their way, to walk before me in faithfulness, with all their heart and with all their soul, no man of yours will be cut off from the throne of Israel.'" </verse>
    <verse num="5">"Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me when he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Jether, and he murdered them and put the blood of war in <transChange type="added">a time of</transChange> peace. He put the blood of war on the leather belt that was on his waist and on the sandals which were on his feet.</verse>
    <verse num="6">You must act according to your wisdom, but you must not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Regarding the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, you shall do loyal love and let them be among those who eat at your table, because they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And look, Shimei the son of Gera the son of the Benjaminite from Bahurim is with you. Now he {cursed me severely}<note>Literally "cursed me <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a curse"</note> when I went to Mahanaim, but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, so I swore to him by Yahweh, 'I surely will not kill you with the sword.'</verse>
    <verse num="9">So then, do not leave him unpunished, for you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> a wise man, and you will know what you must do to him. You must bring his grey hair down to Sheol with blood." </verse>
    <verse num="10">Then David slept with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The days that David reigned over Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she said, "{Are you coming in peace}?"<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> peace your coming?"</note> He said, "Peace."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then he said, "{May I have a word with you}?"<note>Literally "A word is for me to you"</note> Then she said, "Go on."</verse>
    <verse num="15">He said, "You know that the kingship was mine and that all Israel had set their face toward me as king, but the kingship turned around and became my brother's, for it was from Yahweh for him <transChange type="added">to have it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Now one request I am asking from you, and you must {not refuse me}."<note>Literally "not turn my face"</note> Then she said to him, "Go on."</verse>
    <verse num="17">He said, "Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not refuse you, so that he will give to me Abishag the Shunnamite as wife."</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Bathsheba said, "Very well, I will speak to the king concerning you." </verse>
    <verse num="19">Bathsheba came to King Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonijah, and the king got up to meet her, bowed down to her, and then sat on his throne. Then he set up a throne for the king's mother, and she sat on his right.</verse>
    <verse num="20">She said, "I have one small request I am asking from you. Do {not refuse me}."<note>Literally "not turn my face"</note> The king said to her, "Ask, my mother, for I will {not refuse you}."<note>Literally "not turn your face"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">Then she said, "Let Abishag the Shunnamite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife."</verse>
    <verse num="22">King Solomon answered and said to his mother, "Why are you asking Abishag the Shunnamite for Adonijah? Ask for him also the kingdom, for he is my brother, older than I; and <transChange type="added">ask</transChange> for him also Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah."</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then King Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, "Thus may God do to me and thus may he add, if Adonijah hasn't spoken this thing at the expense of his life.</verse>
    <verse num="24">So then, {as Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "the life of Yahweh"</note> who has established me and seated me on the throne of my father David and who has established for me a dynasty as he promised, then surely Adonijah will be put to death today."</verse>
    <verse num="25">King Solomon sent through the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, so he struck him, and he died. </verse>
    <verse num="26">To Abiathar the priest, the king said, "Go to Anathoth, to your field, for {you deserve to die},<note>Literally "you are a man of death"</note> but on this day I will not kill you, for you carried the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because you endured hardship in all the hardship that my father endured."</verse>
    <verse num="27">So Solomon banished Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, thus fulfilling the word which Yahweh had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. </verse>
    <verse num="28">When the message came to Joab (now Joab {had supported}<note>Literally "had turned after"</note> Adonijah but {had not supported}<note>Literally "had not turned after"</note> Absalom), he fled to the tent of Yahweh and grasped the horns of the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="29">It was told to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Yahweh and was beside the altar. So Solomon sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, "Go and fall upon him."</verse>
    <verse num="30">So Benaiah went to the tent of Yahweh, and he said to him, "Thus says the king: 'Come out.'" And he said, "No, for I want to die here." So Benaiah returned a word to the king, saying, "Thus Joab spoke, and thus he answered me."</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then the king said to him, "Do as he spoke; fall upon him and bury him, and so you shall remove the innocent blood that Joab shed from on me and from on the house of my father.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Yahweh will return his blood on his head, because he fell upon two men, more righteous and better than he, and he killed them with the sword, even though my father did not know it; <transChange type="added">namely</transChange> Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And their blood will return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever, but for David and his descendants and for his house and his throne, <transChange type="added">there</transChange> will be peace forever from Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="34">So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, and he fell on him and killed him, and he was buried in his house in the wilderness.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Then the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar. </verse>
    <verse num="36">Then the king sent and summoned Shimei, and he said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but you must not go out {anywhere whatsoever}<note>Literally "where and where"</note> from there.</verse>
    <verse num="37">It shall happen that on the day you go out and cross over the Wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> Kidron, know for certain that {you will surely die}.<note>Literally "dying you will die"</note> Your blood will be on your head."</verse>
    <verse num="38">Shimei said to the king, "The word is good that my lord the king has spoken to me; thus will your servant do." So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days. </verse>
    <verse num="39">It happened that at the end of three years, two of Shimei's slaves fled to Achish, son of Maacah, the king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, "Your slaves <transChange type="added">are</transChange> here in Gath."</verse>
    <verse num="40">So Shimei got up and saddled his donkey, and he went to Gath, to Achish, to search for his slaves. So Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath.</verse>
    <verse num="41">When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned,</verse>
    <verse num="42">the king sent and summoned Shimei, and he said to him, "Did I not make you swear by Yahweh? I warned you, saying, 'On the day you go out and you go {anywhere whatsoever},<note>Literally "where and where"</note> know for certain that {you will surely die}.'<note>Literally "dying you will die"</note> And you said to me, 'The word is good; I accept.'</verse>
    <verse num="43">Why have you not kept the oath of Yahweh and the command which I commanded you?"</verse>
    <verse num="44">Then the king said to Shimei, "You know all the evil which your heart knows, what you did to David my father. Now Yahweh will return the evil on your head,</verse>
    <verse num="45">but King Solomon will be blessed and the throne of David will be established before Yahweh forever."</verse>
    <verse num="46">Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him, and he died. So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Solomon intermarried with Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and he took the daughter of Pharaoh and brought her to the city of David until he finished building his house, the house of Yahweh, and the walls of Jerusalem all around.</verse>
    <verse num="2">But the people <transChange type="added">were</transChange> sacrificing on the high places, for the house for the name of Yahweh had not <transChange type="added">yet</transChange> been built in those days.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Solomon loved Yahweh, by walking in the statutes of David his father; only he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sacrificing and offering incense on the high places.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice, for the great high place <transChange type="added">was</transChange> there. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Yahweh appeared to Solomon at Gibeon in a dream at night, and God said, "Ask what I should give to you."</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Solomon said, "You have shown great loyal love with your servant David my father, as he walked before you in faithfulness and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with you. You have shown for him this great loyal love, and you have given a son to him who is sitting on his throne as <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> this day.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So then, O Yahweh, you are my God. You have made your servant king in place of David my father <transChange type="added">though</transChange> I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> a young boy. I do not know going out or coming in.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Your servant <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the middle of your people whom you have chosen; a great people who cannot be counted or numbered because of abundance.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Give to your servant a listening heart to judge your people, to discern between good and bad, because who is able to judge this, your difficult people?" </verse>
    <verse num="10">The word was good in the eyes of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Lord that Solomon had asked this thing.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And God said to him, "Because you have asked this thing and you did not ask for yourself {a long life}<note>Literally "many days"</note> and you did not ask riches for yourself and you did not ask for the life of your enemies, but you have asked for yourself {the ability to make wise judgments};<note>Literally "understanding to hear judgment"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">behold, I do hereby do according to your word. I hereby give you a wise and discerning heart; there was no one like you before you, nor afterwards will one like you arise.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Too, what you have not asked I give to you: both riches and honor, <transChange type="added">so that</transChange> no man among the kings will be like you all of your days.</verse>
    <verse num="14">If you will walk in my ways by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David your father walked, then I will lengthen your days."</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Solomon awoke, and look, <transChange type="added">it was</transChange> a dream, and he came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Lord, and he offered burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings, and he held a feast for all of his servants. </verse>
    <verse num="16">Then two prostitutes came to the king, and they stood before him.</verse>
    <verse num="17">The one woman said, "Please my lord, I and this woman are living in one house, and I gave birth, with her in the house.</verse>
    <verse num="18">It happened on the third day <transChange type="added">after</transChange> my giving birth, this woman also gave birth, and we <transChange type="added">were</transChange> together. There was not anyone with us in the house, only the two of us <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the house.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then the son of this woman died <transChange type="added">in the</transChange> night because she laid on him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">So she got up in the middle of the night, and she took my son from beside me while your servant was asleep, and she put him in her lap, and she put her dead son in my lap.</verse>
    <verse num="21">When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead! When I looked closely at him in the morning, behold, it was not my son whom I had borne."</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then the other woman said, "No, for my son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the living one, and your son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the dead one." The other kept on saying, "No, for your son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the dead one, and my son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the living one," and so they argued in front of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then the king said, "This one <transChange type="added">is</transChange> saying, 'This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> my son, the living one, but your son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the dead one,' and the other one keeps saying, 'But no! Your son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the dead one, and my son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> living!'"</verse>
    <verse num="24">So the king said, "Bring me a sword," and they brought the sword before the king.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then the king said, "Divide the living child into two, and give half to the one and half to the other."</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then the woman whose son <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the living one spoke to the king because her compassion was aroused for her son, and she said, "Please, my lord, give her the living child, but certainly do not kill him!" The other one <transChange type="added">was</transChange> saying, "As for me, so for you! Divide <transChange type="added">him</transChange>!"</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then the king answered and said, "Give the living child to her, and do not kill him; she <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his mother."</verse>
    <verse num="28">When all of Israel heard the judgment that the king had rendered, they {stood in awe}<note>Literally "feared the face"</note> of the king, because they realized that the wisdom of God was in him to execute justice. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">King Solomon was king over all Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now these are the officials who were his: Azariah the son of Zadok <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the priest.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, <transChange type="added">were</transChange> the secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the recorder.</verse>

  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him as king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend for David.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="3">"You knew David my father, that he was not able to build a house for the name of Yahweh his God, {in view of the warfare}<note>Literally "because of the face of the warfare"</note> which surrounded him, until Yahweh placed them<note>That is, David's enemies</note> under the soles of his feet.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But now Yahweh my God has given me rest all around me. There is no adversary, and there is no bad occurrence.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Here I am, intending to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh promised to my father David, saying, 'Your son, whom I will set in your place on your throne, shall build the house for my name.'</verse>
    <verse num="6">So then, command that they may cut cedars for me from Lebanon, and let my servants be with your servants. The wage of your servants I will give to you according to all that you say, for you know that there is no one among us who knows <transChange type="added">how</transChange> to cut timber like the Sidonians."</verse>
    <verse num="7">When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and he said, "Blessed be Yahweh this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people."</verse>
    <verse num="8">Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, "I have heard what you have sent to me; I will do all of your desire concerning the timber of cedars and concerning the timber of cypresses.</verse>
    <verse num="9">My servants will bring <transChange type="added">them</transChange> down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them <transChange type="added">into</transChange> rafts in the sea <transChange type="added">to float to</transChange> the place which you indicated to me. Then I shall break them up there, and you may carry <transChange type="added">them further</transChange>, and {you shall meet my needs}<note>Literally "you shall do my desire"</note> by giving food for my house."</verse>
    <verse num="10">So Hiram was giving to Solomon the cedar timbers and the cypress timbers, {everything he needed}.<note>Literally "all of his desire"</note></verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Solomon gave to Hiram twenty thousand dry measures of wheat <transChange type="added">as</transChange> food for his household, and twenty dry measures of {specially prepared olive oil};<note>Literally "beaten olive oil"</note> thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Yahweh gave wisdom to Solomon as he promised to him, and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> a covenant. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then King Solomon conscripted a forced labor from all Israel, and the forced labor <transChange type="added">numbered</transChange> thirty thousand men.</verse>
    <verse num="14">He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand {every month};<note>Literally "in the month"</note> the work groups were a month in Lebanon and two months at home; now Adoniram was over the forced labor.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Solomon had seventy thousand {common laborers}<note>Literally "carrying burden"</note> and eighty thousand stone craftsmen in the hill country.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Besides the chiefs of the officers Solomon had, there were three thousand three hundred having charge over the people who were doing the work.</verse>
    <verse num="17">When the king commanded, they quarried great stones <transChange type="added">and</transChange> precious stones to lay <transChange type="added">the</transChange> foundation of the house <transChange type="added">with</transChange> hewn stones.</verse>
    <verse num="18">So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites hewed <transChange type="added">stones</transChange>, and they prepared the timber and the stone to build the house. </verse>

  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year <transChange type="added">after</transChange> the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> went out from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year {of Solomon's rule}<note>Literally "Solomon to rule"</note> over Israel, the month of Ziv (that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the second month), that he began to build the house for Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now the house that King Solomon built for Yahweh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sixty cubits <transChange type="added">in</transChange> its length and twenty cubits <transChange type="added">in</transChange> its width and thirty cubits <transChange type="added">in</transChange> its height.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The vestibule on the face of the main hall of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty cubits <transChange type="added">in</transChange> its length, and the width of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> <transChange type="added">was</transChange> ten cubits wide on the face of the temple.<note>Or "house"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">And he made for the temple<note>Or "house"</note> specially designed framed windows,</verse>
    <verse num="5">and he built a structure against the wall of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> <transChange type="added">running</transChange> all along the walls of the house, for the outer sanctuary and for the inner sanctuary, and made side rooms all around.</verse>
    <verse num="6">The lower structure <transChange type="added">was</transChange> five cubits in its width and the middle <transChange type="added">was</transChange> six cubits in its width and the third <transChange type="added">was</transChange> seven cubits in its width, for he made niches for the temple<note>Or "house"</note> all around to the outside, <transChange type="added">so that</transChange> beams <transChange type="added">would</transChange> not attach to the walls of the temple.<note>Or "house"</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">Now while the temple<note>Or "house"</note> was being built, it was built <transChange type="added">with</transChange> stones finished <transChange type="added">at the</transChange> quarry, <transChange type="added">so that</transChange> no hammer or stone shaping tool or any instrument of iron was heard in the temple<note>Or "house"</note> as it was being built.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The doorway of the side room in the middle of the side of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on the south; they went up with a stairway to the middle and from the middle to the third <transChange type="added">floor</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="9">So he built the house and finished it. He covered the temple<note>Or "house"</note> <transChange type="added">with</transChange> rafters and wood planks and with the cedars.</verse>
    <verse num="10">He also built the structure against all of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> five cubits in height and fastened it to the temple<note>Or "house"</note> with beams of cedar. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Then the word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="12">"<transChange type="added">Regarding</transChange> this temple<note>Or "house"</note> that you are building: if you walk in my ordinances and if you do my judgments and you keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will establish my promise with you which I made to David your father.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And I will dwell {among}<note>Literally "in the middle of"</note> the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> and I will not forsake my people Israel." </verse>
    <verse num="14">So Solomon built the temple<note>Or "house"</note> and finished it.</verse>
    <verse num="15">He lined the walls {of the inside of the house}<note>Literally "the house from house"</note> with boards of cedar; from the floor of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> up to the rafters of the ceiling he covered <transChange type="added">them with</transChange> wood {on the inside}.<note>Literally "from house"</note> He also covered the floor of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> with cypress boards.</verse>
    <verse num="16">He built twenty cubits from the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor up to the ceiling, and he built for it an inner sanctuary on the inside, as the {most holy place}.<note>Literally "as the holy place of the holy places."

    <verse num="17">The main hall of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> was forty cubits {in front of the inner sanctuary},<note>So LXX supported by the Vulgate. MT has "before me"</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">with the cedar within the inner house <transChange type="added">having</transChange> carvings of gourds and buds of flowers. It <transChange type="added">was</transChange> entirely of cedar; there was not a stone visible.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Now <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the inner sanctuary in the middle of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> he prepared the inside to place the ark of the covenant of Yahweh there.</verse>
    <verse num="20">In front, the inner sanctuary <transChange type="added">was</transChange> twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it <transChange type="added">with</transChange> pure gold and covered the altar <transChange type="added">with</transChange> cedar.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Solomon overlaid the temple<note>Or "house"</note> on the inside <transChange type="added">with</transChange> pure gold, and he drew across it with golden chains in front of the inner sanctuary, which he overlaid with gold. </verse>
    <verse num="22">All of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> he overlaid with gold until all of the temple<note>Or "house"</note> <transChange type="added">was</transChange> finished; all of the altar which belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.</verse>
    <verse num="23">He made two cherubim of olive wood for the inner sanctuary, ten cubits high.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Five cubits <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the first wing of the cherub, and five cubits the second wing of the cherub, from the tip of his <transChange type="added">one</transChange> wing up to the tip of his <transChange type="added">other</transChange> wing.</verse>
    <verse num="25">The second cherub <transChange type="added">was</transChange> ten cubits <transChange type="added">according to</transChange> {the same}<note>Literally "one"</note> measurement, and <transChange type="added">there</transChange> was one shape for the two cherubim.</verse>
    <verse num="26">The height of the first cherub <transChange type="added">was</transChange> ten cubits and so <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the second cherub. </verse>
    <verse num="27">He placed the cherubim in the middle of the inner house, and they spread out the wings of the cherubim; the wing of the first cherub touched against the wall and the wing of the second cherub <transChange type="added">was</transChange> touching against the second wall; their wings <transChange type="added">spread</transChange> to the middle of the house <transChange type="added">and were</transChange> touching wing to wing.</verse>
    <verse num="28">He also overlaid the cherubim with gold. </verse>
    <verse num="29">On all of the walls around the house, he carved engravings of cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers both inside and out.</verse>
    <verse num="30">He overlaid the floor of the house with gold both inside and out.</verse>
    <verse num="31">He made doors of olive wood for the doorway of the inner sanctuary, <transChange type="added">as well as for</transChange> the doorpost of the fifth doorframe.</verse>
    <verse num="32"><transChange type="added">On</transChange> the two doors of olive wood he made carvings of cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers, and he overlaid them with gold {by beating}<note>Literally "and he beat out"</note> out the gold on the cherubim and the palm tree images.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Thus he made doorframes of olive wood on four sides for the doorway of the main hall</verse>

    <verse num="35">He carved cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then he built the inner courtyard <transChange type="added">with</transChange> three rows of dressed stone and a row of cedar beams.</verse>
    <verse num="37">In the fourth year,<note>That is, the fourth year of Solomon's reign</note> the house of Yahweh was founded in the month of Ziv.</verse>

    <verse num="8">His house where he would live in the next courtyard on the inside of the porch was like this work, and he would make a house like this porch for the daughter of Pharaoh whom Solomon had taken <transChange type="added">as wife</transChange>.</verse>

    <verse num="13">King Solomon invited and received Hiram from Tyre.</verse>
    <verse num="14">He <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the son of a widow woman from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a man of Tyre, an artisan of bronze.

    <verse num="15">He cast the two pillars <transChange type="added">out of</transChange> bronze; eighteen cubits <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the height of the first, and a cord of twelve cubits would encircle the second pillar.</verse>
    <verse num="16">He made two capitals to place on the tops of the pillars <transChange type="added">out of</transChange> molten bronze; the first capital <transChange type="added">was</transChange> five cubits <transChange type="added">in</transChange> height, and the second capital <transChange type="added">was</transChange> five cubits <transChange type="added">in</transChange> height.</verse>

    <verse num="18">He also made the pillars with two rows around on the lattice, each to cover the capitals which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> on top, <transChange type="added">out of</transChange> the pomegranate-shaped ornaments, and thus he did for the second capital <transChange type="added">as well</transChange>.</verse>

    <verse num="44">and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea;</verse>
    <verse num="45">and the pots, the shovels, and the bowls for drinking wine. All the vessels of the tent which Hiram had made for King Solomon <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the house of Yahweh <transChange type="added">were</transChange> polished bronze.</verse>
    <verse num="46">The king had cast them in the plain of the Jordan with the casting mold <transChange type="added">set in</transChange> the ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</verse>
    <verse num="47">Solomon left all of the vessels <transChange type="added">unweighed</transChange> because of their very great abundance, so the weight of the bronze could not be determined. </verse>
    <verse num="48">Solomon also made all of the vessels which <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar and the golden table on which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> the bread of the presence;</verse>

    <verse num="50">The cups, the snuffers, the bowls for drinking wine, the bowls for the incense, and the firepans <transChange type="added">were made from</transChange> beaten gold; the facades for the doors of the inner house, for the {most holy place},<note>Literally "holy of the holiest"</note> for the doors of the main hall of the temple <transChange type="added">were of</transChange> gold.</verse>
    <verse num="51"><transChange type="added">When</transChange> all of the work which king Solomon did on the house of Yahweh was completed, Solomon brought out the holy objects of his father David, the silver and the gold and the vessels, <transChange type="added">which</transChange> he put in the treasury rooms of the house of Yahweh. </verse>

  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">At that time, Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> of the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> before King Solomon, in order to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the city of David, that is, Zion.</verse>
    <verse num="2">All the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon at the festival in the month of Ethnaim, that is, the seventh month.</verse>
    <verse num="3">All the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the ark.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So they brought up the ark of Yahweh and the tent of assembly<note>Or "meeting"</note> and all of the holy vessels that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.</verse>
    <verse num="5">King Solomon and all the assembly of Israel who were assembling with him in the presence of the ark <transChange type="added">were</transChange> sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered because of abundance.</verse>
    <verse num="6">The priests brought the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, to the {most holy place},<note>Literally "holy of the holiest"</note> under the wings of the cherubim,</verse>
    <verse num="7">for the cherubim <transChange type="added">were</transChange> spreading their wings over the place of the ark. The cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles from above.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The poles <transChange type="added">were</transChange> long, and the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place {in front of}<note>Literally "on the face of"</note> the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen <transChange type="added">from</transChange> the outside, and they are there until this day.</verse>
    <verse num="9">There was not <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> in the ark {except}<note>Hebrew "only"</note> the two tablets of stone which Moses had placed there at Horeb, where Yahweh {made}<note>Literally "cut"</note> <transChange type="added">a covenant</transChange> with the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> after they went out from the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="10">When the priests went out from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The priests <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not able to stand to minister {because of the presence of}<note>Literally "from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> face of"</note> the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Solomon said, "Yahweh has said that <transChange type="added">he</transChange> would dwell in the very thick cloud.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I have certainly built a lofty house for you, a place for you to live forever."</verse>
    <verse num="14"><transChange type="added">Then</transChange> the king turned his face around, and he blessed all of the assembly of Israel. (Now all the assembly of Israel was standing).</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then he said, "Blessed be Yahweh the God of Israel who has promised with his mouth <transChange type="added">to</transChange> David my father and fulfilled {by his oath},<note>Literally "by his hand"</note> saying,</verse>
    <verse num="16">'From the day that I brought out my people Israel from Egypt I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house where my name might be, but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.'</verse>
    <verse num="17">{David my father desired}<note>Literally "It had been with<transChange type="added">in</transChange> the heart of David my father"</note> to build a house for the name of Yahweh the God of Israel,</verse>
    <verse num="18">but Yahweh said to David my father, 'Because {you desired}<note>Literally "it was within your heart"</note> to build a house for my name, you did well in that it was within your heart.</verse>
    <verse num="19">However, you will not build the house, but your son who has come from your loins, he shall build the house for my name.'</verse>
    <verse num="20">Yahweh has carried out his promise which he had made; I have risen in place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel as Yahweh promised, and I have built the house for the name of Yahweh the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="21">I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant which Yahweh made with our ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> when He brought them out of the land of Egypt." </verse>
    <verse num="22">Then Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all of the assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the heavens,</verse>
    <verse num="23">and he said, "O Yahweh, God of Israel, there is no god like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and the loyal love for your servants who are walking before you with all their heart.</verse>
    <verse num="24">You have kept for your servant David my father what you promised to him, and you have spoken with your mouth, and with your hand you have fulfilled <transChange type="added">it</transChange> this very day.</verse>
    <verse num="25">So then, O Yahweh, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you promised to him, saying, 'For you, no man will be cut off from before me who <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> sitting on the throne of Israel, if only your sons keep their ways to walk before me just as you have walked before me.'</verse>
    <verse num="26">So then, O God of Israel, please let your word be confirmed which you have promised<note>Or "spoken"</note> to your servant David my father.</verse>
    <verse num="27">For will God really dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens could not contain you! {How could}<note>Literally "Even that"</note> this house that I have built?</verse>
    <verse num="28">You must regard the prayer of your servant and his plea! O Yahweh my God, listen to the pleading and to the prayer that your servant <transChange type="added">is</transChange> praying before you this day,</verse>
    <verse num="29">so that your eyes <transChange type="added">will</transChange> be open to this house night and day, to the place which you said, 'My name will be there,' to hear the prayer that your servant prays toward this place.</verse>
    <verse num="30">You must listen to the plea of your servant and your people Israel which they pray <transChange type="added">toward</transChange> this place; and you must hear from the place where you live, from heaven you must hear and you must forgive.</verse>
    <verse num="31"><transChange type="added">If</transChange> a man sins against his neighbor and he pronounces an oath against him to curse him, and the curse comes before your altar in this house,</verse>
    <verse num="32">then you shall hear in heaven and you shall act and you shall judge your servant, to declare the wicked guilty by bringing his way upon his head and {to declare the righteous innocent}<note>Literally "to declare righteous the righteous"</note> by rewarding him according to his righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="33">When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy {because}<note>Literally "who"</note> they sinned against you, and <transChange type="added">when</transChange> they turn to you and confess your name and pray and beg for mercy from you in this house,</verse>
    <verse num="34">then you shall hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and you shall bring them back to the ground which you gave to their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="35">When you shut up the heavens so there is no rain because they have sinned against you, then they pray to this place and they confess your name and they return from their sin because you punished them,</verse>
    <verse num="36">then you shall hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and your people Israel, for you will teach them the good way in which they should go, and you will give rain upon your land which you have given to your people as an inheritance.</verse>
    <verse num="37">If there should be in the land famine or disease, if there should be blight or mildew or locust or caterpillars, if it happens that his enemy lays siege against him in the land of his gates, if any plague or any disease,</verse>
    <verse num="38">any prayer or any plea which is <transChange type="added">offered</transChange> by any person for all of your people Israel, who each knows the infestation of his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> heart and spreads out his palms to this house,</verse>
    <verse num="39">then you shall hear in heaven the place of your dwelling, and you shall forgive and act and give to the man whose heart you know, according to all his ways, for you alone know the heart of all the sons of man.</verse>
    <verse num="40"><transChange type="added">Do these things</transChange> so that they may fear you all the days that they live on the face of the land that you gave to our ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="41">Also for the foreigner who is not from your people Israel, and he comes from a distant land because of your name,</verse>
    <verse num="42">(for they shall hear of your great name and your powerful hand and your outstretched arm), and he shall come and pray toward this house,</verse>
    <verse num="43">you shall hear in heaven, the place of your dwelling, and act according to all that the foreigner calls to you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you as your people Israel, and to know that your name has been invoked over this house that I have built.</verse>
    <verse num="44">If your people go out to battle against his enemy in the way that you shall send them and they pray to Yahweh, toward the city which you have chosen and the house which I have built for your name,</verse>

    <verse num="48">if they return to you with all of their heart and with all of their soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive and they pray to you toward their land which you gave to their ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> the city that you have chosen and the house that you<note>The Hebrew Masoretic text (Kethib) reads "you have built";Qere reads "I have built"</note> built for your name,</verse>
    <verse num="49">then you shall hear in heaven, the place of your dwelling, their prayer and their plea, and you shall {vindicate them}.<note>Literally "and you shall do their justice"</note></verse>
    <verse num="50">You shall forgive your people who sinned against you, <transChange type="added">even</transChange> for all their transgressions which they committed against you. You shall give them compassion before their captors so that they may have compassion on them,</verse>

    <verse num="53">For you have separated them for yourself as an inheritance from all the peoples of the earth, as you promised through the hand of Moses your servant when you brought out our ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> from Egypt, my Lord Yahweh!" </verse>
    <verse num="54">It happened that when Solomon finished praying to Yahweh all of the prayer and this plea, he got up from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling down on his knees with his palms outstretched to heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="55">He stood and blessed all of the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="56">"Blessed be Yahweh who gave a resting place to his people Israel. According to all that he promised, not one word has fallen from all of his promises <transChange type="added">concerning</transChange> the good which he spoke through the hand of Moses his servant.</verse>
    <verse num="57">May Yahweh our God be with us as he was with our ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and may he not leave us or abandon us,</verse>
    <verse num="58">to incline our hearts toward him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his judgments which he commanded our ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="59">Let these my words which I pleaded before Yahweh <transChange type="added">be</transChange> near to Yahweh our God, by day and by night, to maintain the justice of his servant and the justice of his people Israel {as each day requires}<note>Literally "the word of the day on its day"</note></verse>
    <verse num="60">so that all of the people of the earth may know that Yahweh, he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> God; there is none other.</verse>
    <verse num="61">Let your heart be completely with Yahweh our God by walking in his statutes, by keeping his commands as this day." </verse>
    <verse num="62">Then the king and all of Israel with him offered a sacrifice in the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="63">Solomon sacrificed the fellowship offerings which he offered to Yahweh: twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep; and the king and all of the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> dedicated the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="64">On that day the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard before the house of Yahweh because he offered there the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings because the bronze altar that was in the presence of Yahweh was too small to hold the burnt offerings and the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings.</verse>
    <verse num="65">Solomon held the festival at that time and all of Israel with him, a great assembly from Lebo Hamath up to the wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> of Egypt before Yahweh our God, for seven days <transChange type="added">and</transChange> seven days, <transChange type="added">a total of</transChange> fourteen days.</verse>
    <verse num="66">On the eighth day, he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and they went to their tents rejoicing and {in good spirits}<note>Literally "and good of heart"</note> because of all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant and to Israel his people. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">It happened that as Solomon finished the building of the house of Yahweh, the king's house, and all the things Solomon desired to do,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Yahweh appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him in Gibeon.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Yahweh said to him, "I have heard your prayer and your plea which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house which you have built, by putting my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.</verse>
    <verse num="4">As for you, if you walk before me as David your father walked, with {integrity of heart}<note>Literally "in blamelessness of heart"</note> and with uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, <transChange type="added">and if</transChange> you keep my ordinances and my judgments,</verse>
    <verse num="5">then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, 'A man will not be cut off for you from upon the throne of Israel.' </verse>
    <verse num="6">"If ever you or any of your descendants<note>Or "children"</note> turn from <transChange type="added">following</transChange> me and do not keep my commandments <transChange type="added">and</transChange> my ordinances that I have set before you and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them,</verse>
    <verse num="7">then I will cut Israel off from the face of the land that I have given to them, <transChange type="added">even</transChange> the house which I have consecrated for my name I will cast away from my face; and Israel shall become a proverb and an object of taunting among all the peoples.</verse>
    <verse num="8">This house shall become a heap of ruins; all those passing by will be appalled by it and hiss, and they will say, 'On what account did Yahweh do this to this land and to this house?'</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they will say, 'Because they have forsaken Yahweh their God who brought their ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> out from the land of Egypt and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them. Therefore, Yahweh brought on them all of this disaster.'" </verse>
    <verse num="10">It happened at the end of twenty years <transChange type="added">in</transChange> which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the house of the king,</verse>
    <verse num="11"><transChange type="added">since</transChange> Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with wood of cedar and with wood of cypresses and with the gold according to all his desire, then King Solomon gave twenty cities in the land of the Galilee to Hiram.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So Hiram went out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, but they were not right in his eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So he said, "What <transChange type="added">are</transChange> these cities that you have given to me, my brother?" {So they are called the land of Cabul until this day}.<note>Literally "So he called them the land of Cabul up to this day"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Hiram sent to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold. </verse>
    <verse num="15">This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the account of the forced labor that King Solomon conscripted to build the house of Yahweh and his house, the Millo, the walls of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had gone up and captured Gezer and burnt it with fire. He had also killed the Canaanites who were living in the city and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, the wife of Solomon.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Solomon rebuilt Gezer and Lower Beth-Horon,</verse>
    <verse num="18"><transChange type="added">as well as</transChange> Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness in the land;</verse>
    <verse num="19">and <transChange type="added">he also built</transChange> all of the storage cities which were Solomon's, the cities <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the chariots, the cities <transChange type="added">for</transChange> the cavalry, and all of Solomon's desire that he wanted<note>Or "desired"</note> to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion. </verse>
    <verse num="20">All of the people who were remaining from the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> not of the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">their children who remained after them in the land, whom the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> were not able to completely destroy, Solomon conscripted them for forced labor, until this very day.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But from the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> Solomon did not make a slave, but they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> the men of war, his officers, his commanders, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and his cavalry.</verse>
    <verse num="23">These <transChange type="added">were</transChange> the commanders of the overseers who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> over the work for Solomon, five hundred and fifty, ruling over the people doing the work. </verse>
    <verse num="24">As soon as the daughter of Pharaoh went up from the city of David to her house which he<note>That is, Solomon</note> built for her, then he built the Millo. </verse>
    <verse num="25">Solomon sacrificed three times a year: burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar that he had built to Yahweh, and he offered incense with it before Yahweh; and so he completed the house. </verse>
    <verse num="26">King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-Geber which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> near Elath on the shore of the {Red Sea}<note>Literally "sea of reed"</note> in the land of Edom.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Hiram sent his servants with the fleet of ships, {sailors}<note>Literally "men of ships"</note> who knew the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</verse>
    <verse num="28">They went to Ophir and imported from there four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and they brought it to King Solomon. </verse>

  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">Now the queen of Sheba had heard of the fame of Solomon regarding the name of Yahweh, and she came to test him with hard questions.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So she came to Jerusalem with very great wealth; <transChange type="added">with</transChange> camels carrying spices, very much gold, and precious stones. She came to Solomon, and she spoke to him all that was on her heart.</verse>
    <verse num="3">{Solomon answered all of her questions};<note>Literally "Solomon told her all of her words"</note> there was not a thing hidden from the king which he could not explain to her.</verse>

    <verse num="29">A chariot went up and went out from Egypt at six hundred silver <transChange type="added">shekels</transChange> and a horse at a hundred and fifty. So it was for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Aram; by their hand they were exported. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">King Solomon loved many foreign women: the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, Hittite;</verse>
    <verse num="2">from the nations which Yahweh had said to the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> "You shall not {marry them},<note>Literally "go into them"</note> and they shall not {marry you}.<note>Literally "go into you"</note> They will certainly turn your heart after other gods." But Solomon clung to them to love.</verse>
    <verse num="3">He had seven hundred princesses and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart. </verse>
    <verse num="4">It happened at the time of Solomon's old age that his wives guided his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully with Yahweh his God as the heart of David his father <transChange type="added">had been</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Solomon went after Ashtoreth the god of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Sidonians and after Molech the abhorrence of the Ammonites.</verse>
    <verse num="6">So Solomon did evil in the eyes of Yahweh and did not fully <transChange type="added">follow</transChange> after Yahweh as David his father.</verse>
    <verse num="7">At that time, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, on the mountain which {faces}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">was</transChange> on the face of"</note> Jerusalem and for Molech, the abomination of the {Ammonites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Thus he did for all of his foreign wives, offering incense and sacrificing to their gods. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Yahweh was angry with Solomon, for he had turned his heart from Yahweh, the God of Israel who had appeared to him twice.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he had commanded him concerning this matter not to go after other gods, but he did not keep that which Yahweh commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So Yahweh said to Solomon, "Because this was with you, and you did not keep my covenant and my ordinances which I have commanded you, I will certainly tear the kingdom from you, and I will give it to your servant.</verse>
    <verse num="12">However, I will not do it in your days, for the sake of David your father; from the hand of your son I will tear it <transChange type="added">away</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Yet all of the kingdom I will not tear <transChange type="added">away</transChange>. I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen." </verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Yahweh raised an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, from the descendants of that king in Edom.</verse>
    <verse num="15">It had happened that when David was at Edom, Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, and he killed every male in Edom.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months until he exterminated every male in Edom.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But Hadad himself had fled, and some Edomite men from the servants of his father with him, to go to Egypt, when Hadad <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a young boy.</verse>
    <verse num="18">They had set out from Midian until they came to Paran where they took men from Paran with them and came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Egypt, <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Pharaoh king of Egypt. He gave to him a house and assigned food for him and gave him land.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Hadad found great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, and he gave him the sister of his wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen, as wife.</verse>
    <verse num="20">The sister of Tahpenes bore Genubath his son for him, and Tahpenes weaned him in the middle of the house of Pharaoh. Genubath was <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the house of Pharaoh in the midst of the children<note>Or "sons"</note> of Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Now Hadad heard in Egypt that David had slept with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> and that Joab the commander of the army was dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Send me away that I may go to my land."</verse>
    <verse num="22">Pharaoh said to him, "What do you lack with me that you now <transChange type="added">are</transChange> seeking to go to your land?" He said, "No, but you must surely send me away." </verse>
    <verse num="23">God had <transChange type="added">also</transChange> raised Rezon the son of Eliada as an adversary against him, who had fled from Hadadezer the king of Zobah, his master.</verse>
    <verse num="24">He gathered men around him and he became the commander of bandits. When David killed <transChange type="added">some of</transChange> them, they went to Damascus and settled {there},<note>Literally "in it"</note> and they reigned in Damascus.</verse>
    <verse num="25">He was an adversary for Israel all the days of Solomon, and <transChange type="added">along with</transChange> the evil that Hadad <transChange type="added">did</transChange>, he detested Israel <transChange type="added">while</transChange> he reigned over Aram. </verse>
    <verse num="26">Now Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah (now the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Zeruah, a widow woman), a servant of Solomon {rebelled against the king}.<note>Literally "raised a hand against the king"</note></verse>
    <verse num="27">This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the reason that he rebelled against the king: <transChange type="added">when</transChange> Solomon built the Millo, he closed the gap of the city of David his father.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Now the man Jeroboam <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a man of ability, and Solomon saw that the young man {was a diligent worker},<note>Literally "was a doer of work he"</note> so he appointed him over all of the forced labor for the house of Joseph.</verse>
    <verse num="29">It happened at that time that Jeroboam went out from Jerusalem, and he accidentally met Ahijah the Shilonite the prophet on the way. Now he had clothed himself with new clothing. While the two of them <transChange type="added">were</transChange> alone in the field,</verse>
    <verse num="30">Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on him and tore it into twelve pieces.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then he said to Jeroboam, "Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I <transChange type="added">am about</transChange> to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and I will give to you ten tribes,</verse>
    <verse num="32">but one tribe shall be for him, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel;</verse>
    <verse num="33">because he has forsaken me, and they bowed down to Ashtoreth, the god of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Sidonians, to Chemosh, the god of Moab, and to Molech, the god of the {Ammonites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Ammon"</note> They did not walk in my ways to do right in my eyes, my ordinances, or my judgments, as <transChange type="added">did</transChange> David his father.</verse>
    <verse num="34">But I will not take all of the kingdom from his hand, but I will make him a leader all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my ordinances.</verse>
    <verse num="35">But I will take the kingship from the hand of his son, and I will give ten tribes to you.</verse>
    <verse num="36">To his son I will give one tribe in order to be a lamp for my servant David, always before my face, in Jerusalem the city in which I have chosen to place my name.</verse>
    <verse num="37">You I will take, and you shall reign over all your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="38">It shall be that if you listen to all that I command you and you walk in my ways and you do right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, then I will be with you, and I will build an enduring house for you as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.</verse>
    <verse num="39">I will punish the offspring of David on account of this; however, not always.'"</verse>
    <verse num="40">Then Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam got up and fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king of Egypt, and he remained in Egypt until the death of Solomon. </verse>
    <verse num="41">Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and all that he did and his wisdom; <transChange type="added">are</transChange> they not written on the scroll of the acts of Solomon?</verse>
    <verse num="42">All the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all of Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> forty years.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Then Solomon slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and they buried him in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son became king in his place. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all of Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.</verse>
    <verse num="2">It happened that Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard <transChange type="added">of it</transChange> while he was still in Egypt where he had fled from the face of King Solomon, and Jeroboam had lived in Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="3">So they sent and summoned him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came. <transChange type="added">Then</transChange> they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="4">"Your father made our yoke heavy; now lighten the hard labor of your father and the heavy yoke which he placed on us, and we will serve you."</verse>
    <verse num="5">He said, "Go up for three days and then return to me"; so the people went away. </verse>
    <verse num="6">Then King Rehoboam consulted with the old men who had been {serving}<note>Literally "standing"</note> before Solomon his father when he was alive, saying, "How <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you advising <transChange type="added">me</transChange> {to answer this people}?"<note>Literally "to return a word to this people"</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">They said to him, "If you will be a servant today to this people, then you will serve them; and if you answer them and speak good words to them, they will always be your servants."</verse>
    <verse num="8">But he rejected the advice of the old men, which they gave him, and he consulted with the youngsters who had grown up with him, who were {serving}<note>Literally "standing"</note> before him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He said to them, "What <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you advising that we should reply to this people who spoke to me by saying, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us.'"</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the youngsters who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, "Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you: 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten <transChange type="added">it</transChange> for us,' you shall say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So then, my father loaded a heavy yoke on all of you, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions!'" </verse>
    <verse num="12">Jeroboam and all of the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken: "Return to me on the third day."</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then the king answered all the people harshly, <transChange type="added">as</transChange> he had rejected the advice of the old men that they had offered.</verse>
    <verse num="14">He spoke to them according to the advice of the youngsters, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add onto your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."</verse>
    <verse num="15">So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turning of events from Yahweh in order to fulfill his word which Yahweh had spoken through the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</verse>
    <verse num="16">When all of Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, "{What share do we have in David}?<note>Literally "What is for us a share in David"</note> <transChange type="added">There is</transChange> no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now look to your house, David!" Then Israel went to their<note>Hebrew "his"</note> tents. </verse>
    <verse num="17">The {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> were living in the cities of Judah, and Rehoboam was reigning over them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">King Rehoboam sent Adoram who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the forced labor, and all of Israel cast stones at him and he died, but King Rehoboam managed to get up on the chariot to flee <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day. </verse>
    <verse num="20">It happened that just when all of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all of Israel. Not one <transChange type="added">followed</transChange> after the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone.</verse>
    <verse num="21">When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all of the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand {choice troops}<note>Literally "chosen makers of war"</note> to fight with the house of Israel, to restore the kingship to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="23">"Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon the king of Judah and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and the remainder of the people, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="24">'Thus says Yahweh: "You shall not go up and you shall not fight with your brothers the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> Return each of you to his house, for this thing was from me." '" So they heeded the word of Yahweh, and they returned to go home according to the word of Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and he resided in it. Then he went out from there and built Penuel.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then Jeroboam {said to himself},<note>Literally "said to his heart"</note> "Now the kingdom will return to the house of David</verse>
    <verse num="27">if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house<note>Or "temple"</note> of Yahweh in Jerusalem. The heart of this people will return to their master Rehoboam the king of Judah, and they shall kill me and {return to him}."<note>Hebrew "return to Rehoboam the king of Judah"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="28">And the king had decided, so he made two golden calves and he said to them,<note>That is, the people</note> "{You have been going up to Jerusalem long enough};<note>Literally "enough for you from going up to Jerusalem"</note> here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt."</verse>
    <verse num="29">He put one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.</verse>
    <verse num="30">This thing became a sin, and the people walked before the one as far as Dan.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then he built the houses on the high places, and he appointed priests {from all walks of life}<note>Literally "from the fringes of the people"</note> who were not from the sons of Levi.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Jeroboam also inaugurated a religious feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the religious feast which was in Judah, and he offered <transChange type="added">sacrifices</transChange> on the altar. Thus he did in Bethel, by sacrificing to the calves that he had made; and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.</verse>
    <verse num="33">He offered <transChange type="added">sacrifices</transChange> on the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month which his heart had devised. He inaugurated a religious feast for the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> and he went up to the altar to offer incense. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">Suddenly a man of God from Judah came to Bethel, by the word of Yahweh, while Jeroboam <transChange type="added">was</transChange> standing at the altar to offer incense.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then he proclaimed against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, "O altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: 'Look, a son will be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall burn on you.'" </verse>
    <verse num="3">He gave a sign on that day, saying, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the sign that Yahweh has predetermined: Look, <transChange type="added">this</transChange> altar will be torn <transChange type="added">apart</transChange>, and the ashes that <transChange type="added">are</transChange> on it will be poured out." </verse>
    <verse num="4">It happened at the moment the king heard the word of the man of God that he cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, "Seize him!" But his hand which he stretched out to him was paralyzed, and he was not able to draw it back to himself.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the altar was torn <transChange type="added">apart</transChange> and the ashes from the altar poured out according to the sign which the man of God had announced by the word of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the king responded and said to the man of God, "Please entreat the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me that my hand may return to me." So the man of God entreated the face of Yahweh, and the hand of the king returned to him, as it was in the beginning.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then the king spoke to the man of God, "Come with me to the house and refresh yourself, that I may give you a gift."</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then the man of God said to the king, "Even if you give to me half of your house I will not come with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water in this place,</verse>
    <verse num="9">for the word of Yahweh has commanded me, saying, 'You shall not eat bread nor drink water, and you shall not return on the way that you came.'"</verse>
    <verse num="10">So he went another way, and he did not return by the way on which he had come to Bethel. </verse>
    <verse num="11">Now a certain older prophet was living in Bethel, and his son came and recounted to him all of the things that the man of God had done that day in Bethel <transChange type="added">and</transChange> the words he had spoken to the king, and they told them to their father.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then their father asked them, "{Which way did he go}?"<note>Literally "Where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this way he went?"</note> His sons had seen the way which the man of God who had come from Judah had taken.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it</verse>
    <verse num="14">and went after the man of God. He found him sitting under the oak and said to him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" He said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then he said to him, "Come with me to the house and eat <transChange type="added">some</transChange> food."</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then he said, "I am not able to return with you or to go with you. I will not eat food nor will I drink water with you in this place.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For a word <transChange type="added">came</transChange> to me by the word of Yahweh, 'You shall not eat food, nor shall you drink water there. You shall not return to go by the way that you came.'" </verse>
    <verse num="18">Then he said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> also a prophet like you. An angel spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, 'Let him return with you to your house that he may eat food and drink water.'" He lied to him.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So he returned with him and ate food in his house and drank water. </verse>
    <verse num="20">Now it happened that they <transChange type="added">were</transChange> sitting at the table, and the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back.</verse>
    <verse num="21">He proclaimed to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, "Thus says Yahweh: 'Because you have disobeyed the word of Yahweh and have not kept the command which Yahweh your God commanded you,</verse>
    <verse num="22">but you have returned and have eaten food and drank water in the place which he ordered you not to eat food nor to drink water, then your dead body shall not return to the tomb of your ancestors.'"<note>Or "fathers"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="23">It happened after he ate food and drank water that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.</verse>
    <verse num="24">When he left, a lion found him on the road and killed him, and his dead body <transChange type="added">was</transChange> thrown on the road with the donkey standing beside it, and the lion <transChange type="added">was</transChange> standing by the dead body.</verse>
    <verse num="25">As men <transChange type="added">were</transChange> passing by and they saw the dead body thrown in the road and the lion standing beside the dead body, they came and told it in the city where the old prophet <transChange type="added">was</transChange> living.</verse>
    <verse num="26">When the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard, he said, "It <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the man of God who disobeyed the mouth of Yahweh, and Yahweh has given him to the lion. He tore him in pieces and killed him according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken to him."</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then he spoke to his sons, saying, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled it.</verse>
    <verse num="28">He went and found his dead body thrown in the road and a donkey with the lion standing beside it, but the lion had not eaten the corpse nor attacked the donkey.</verse>
    <verse num="29">So the prophet lifted up the corpse of the man of God and put it on the donkey and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn him and to bury him.</verse>
    <verse num="30">He put his corpse in his tomb, and they mourned over him, "Alas, my brother!"</verse>
    <verse num="31">It happened after he buried him that he said to his sons, "When I die, you shall bury me in the tomb where the man of God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> buried; you shall lay my bones beside his bones.</verse>
    <verse num="32">For surely, the thing which he proclaimed by the word of Yahweh against the altar which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in Bethel will happen, <transChange type="added">as it will</transChange> against all the houses of the high places which <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in the cities of Samaria." </verse>
    <verse num="33">After this event, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but he returned and <transChange type="added">again</transChange> made priests for the high places of people from {all walks of life}.<note>Literally "from the fringes of the people"</note> He filled his hand with all <transChange type="added">his</transChange> desire and became <transChange type="added">one of</transChange> the priests of the high places <transChange type="added">himself</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="34">This matter became sin in the house of Jeroboam, to make it disappear and to destroy <transChange type="added">it</transChange> from the surface of the earth. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="14">
    <verse num="1">At that time, Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Jeroboam said to his wife, "Please get up and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the wife of Jeroboam, and go <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Shiloh. Look, Ahijah the prophet is there, and he spoke concerning me <transChange type="added">before I became</transChange> king over this people.</verse>
    <verse num="3">You must take ten loaves of bread in your hand and cakes and a jar of honey, and you must go to him. He shall tell you what will happen to the boy."</verse>
    <verse num="4">The wife of Jeroboam did so. She got up, went <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Shiloh, and came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah was not able to see, for {his eyes were fixed}<note>Literally "his eyes stood"</note> because of his old age.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Yahweh said to Ahijah, "Look, the wife of Jeroboam <transChange type="added">is</transChange> coming to seek a word from you about her son, for he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> ill. {Thus and so}<note>Literally "As this and as this"</note> you shall say to her. When she comes, she <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> disguising herself."</verse>
    <verse num="6">It happened at the moment Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps coming through the doorway, he said, "Come <transChange type="added">in</transChange>, wife of Jeroboam. Why <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you making yourself unrecognizable? I have been sent a hard <transChange type="added">message</transChange> for you:</verse>
    <verse num="7">Go, tell Jeroboam, 'Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: "Because I raised you from the midst of the people and I made you leader over my people Israel,</verse>
    <verse num="8">I tore the kingdom from the house of David and I gave it to you. But you were not like my servant David who kept my commandments, and who went after me with all his heart, to do only <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> right in my eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="9">But you did more evil than all who were before you. You have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten idols to provoke me, but me you have {completely disregarded}.<note>Literally "hurled behind your back"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore, look, I am about to bring disaster upon the house of Jeroboam, and I will cut off {males}<note>Literally "those who urinate against a wall"</note> from Jeroboam, bond or free, in Israel. I will burn after the house of Jeroboam as one burns after the manure, until it is finished.</verse>
    <verse num="11">He who dies for Jeroboam in the city, the dogs will eat. He who dies in the open field, the birds from the heavens will eat, for Yahweh has spoken <transChange type="added">it</transChange>." '</verse>
    <verse num="12">As for you, get up. Go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child will die.</verse>
    <verse num="13">All of Israel will mourn for him, and they will bury him. This one alone will come to a tomb for Jeroboam, because a good thing has been found in him by Yahweh the God of Israel in the house of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Yahweh will raise up a king for himself over Israel who will even now cut off the house of Jeroboam this day.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Yahweh will strike Israel as one shakes the reed plant in the water, and he will root Israel up from this good land that he gave to their ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note> He will scatter them beyond the River<note>That is, the Euphrates</note> because they have made their sacred poles <transChange type="added">which are</transChange> provoking Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="16">He will give up Israel because of the sin of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he caused Israel to sin." </verse>

    <verse num="21">Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.

    <verse num="22">But Judah did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and they annoyed him more than their fathers<note>Or "ancestors"</note> did with their sins that they had committed.</verse>
    <verse num="23">They also built for themselves high places and stone pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree.</verse>
    <verse num="24">There were also male shrine prostitutes in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh had driven out from before the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="25">It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,</verse>
    <verse num="26">and he took the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and he took all the treasures of the king's house. He took the small gold shields that Solomon had made,</verse>
    <verse num="27">so King Rehoboam made small copper shields in place of them and {entrusted them}<note>Literally "he assigned on the hand"</note> to the commanders of the royal guard who keep the doorway of the king's house.</verse>

  <chapter num="15">
    <verse num="1">In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. The name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.</verse>
    <verse num="3">He walked in all the sins of his father that he had done before him, and his heart was not fully with Yahweh his God as the heart of David his father.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For the sake of David, Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, by establishing his son after him and by causing Jerusalem to exist;</verse>
    <verse num="5">because David did right in the eyes of Yahweh and he didn't turn aside from all that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. </verse>
    <verse num="6">There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.</verse>

    <verse num="9">In the twentieth year of Jeroboam the king of Israel, Asa became the king of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="10">He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Asa did right in the eyes of Yahweh, like David his ancestor.<note>Or "father"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">He put away the male shrine prostitutes from the land, and he removed all of the idols that his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> made.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Also, he had Maacah his mother removed from the office of queen mother, <transChange type="added">as</transChange> she had made a repulsive image for the Asherah.

    <verse num="14">But the high places he did not remove. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was completely with Yahweh all of his days.</verse>
    <verse num="15">He brought the holy objects of his father and his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> holy objects to the house of Yahweh, silver and gold and utensils. </verse>
    <verse num="16">There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all of their days.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and he built Ramah {to hinder the coming and going of anyone to Asa}<note>Literally "to not give going and coming to Asa"</note> king of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Asa took all of the silver and gold remaining in the storerooms of the house of Yahweh and in the treasury rooms of the house of the king, and he gave them into the hand of his servants; so King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon the son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="19">"<transChange type="added">Let there be</transChange> a covenant between me and you, between my father and your father. Look, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold.

    <verse num="20">Ben-Hadad listened to King Asa, and he sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel and he attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-Beth-Maacah, and all of Kinnereth, in addition to all the land of Naphtali.</verse>
    <verse num="21">When Baasha heard, he stopped building Ramah, and he lived in Tirzah.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then King Asa proclaimed among all of Israel that there was no one free from obligation, so they carried the stones of Ramah and its wood with which Baasha had built, and King Asa rebuilt Geba in Benjamin with them, and the Mizpah.</verse>

    <verse num="27">Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. Now Nadab and all of Israel <transChange type="added">were</transChange> laying siege to Gibbethon,</verse>
    <verse num="28">and Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa the king of Judah, and he reigned in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="29">It happened that as soon as he became king, he killed all of the house of Jeroboam. There was no one left of Jeroboam who breathed, until he had destroyed him according to the word of Yahweh that he had spoken by the hand of his servant, Ahijah the Shilonite,</verse>
    <verse num="30">because of the sins of Jeroboam that he had committed and that he had caused Israel to commit <transChange type="added">and</transChange> because of his anger <transChange type="added">with</transChange> which he had provoked Yahweh the God of Israel.</verse>

  <chapter num="16">
    <verse num="1">The word of Yahweh came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">"Because I exalted you from the dust and I made you a leader over my people Israel, but you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and you caused my people Israel to sin, to provoke me with their sins,</verse>
    <verse num="3">I am now <transChange type="added">about to</transChange> consume Baasha and his house. I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</verse>

    <verse num="6">Baasha slept with his ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah his son became king in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Moreover, the word of Yahweh came to Baasha and to his house by the hand of Jehu the son of Hanani the prophet, because of all the evil that he did in the eyes of Yahweh by provoking him with the work of his hands, by being like the house of Jeroboam; and he destroyed him. </verse>
    <verse num="8">In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel for two years.</verse>
    <verse num="9">His servant Zimri the commander of half of the chariots conspired against him. Now he had been in Tirzah drinking <transChange type="added">himself</transChange> drunk in the house of Arza who was over the palace in Tirzah.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Zimri came and struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah and became king in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="11">It happened that as soon as he became king, at the moment he sat on his throne, he killed all of the house of Baasha.

    <verse num="12">So Zimri destroyed all of the house of Baasha according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke against Baasha by the hand of Jehu the prophet</verse>

    <verse num="15">In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the army was encamping against Gibbethon which belonged to the Philistines.</verse>
    <verse num="16">The encamping army heard that Zimri had conspired and moreover had killed the king,<note>That is, Elah</note> so they made Omri the commander of the army of Israel king over all Israel in the camp on that day.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Omri went up and all Israel with him from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah.</verse>
    <verse num="18">It happened that when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went to the citadel fortress of the house of the king, and he burnt the house of the king over him with fire so that he died.</verse>
    <verse num="19"><transChange type="added">This happened</transChange> because of his sin which he committed by doing evil in the eyes of Yahweh, by going the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he did by causing Israel to sin.</verse>

    <verse num="21">At that time, the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people went after Tibni the son of Ginath to make him king, and the other half went after Omri.</verse>
    <verse num="22">The people who went after Omri overcame the people who went after Tibni the son of Ginath, so that he died and Omri became king. </verse>
    <verse num="23">In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel <transChange type="added">for</transChange> twelve years. He reigned in Tirzah six years,</verse>
    <verse num="24">then bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, fortified the hill, and called the name of the city Samaria that he built after Shemer, the owner of the hill.</verse>
    <verse num="25">But Omri did evil in the eyes of Yahweh more than all who were before him.</verse>

    <verse num="28">Omri slept with his ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and he was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son became king in his place. </verse>
    <verse num="29">Now Ahab son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah. Ahab son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.</verse>
    <verse num="30">But Ahab son of Omri did evil in the eyes of Yahweh more than all who were before him.</verse>
    <verse num="31">{If it wasn't enough that he went}<note>Literally "It happened that it was trivial his going"</note> after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he also took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal the king of the Sidonians.

    <verse num="32">And he built an altar to Baal in the house of Baal which he had built in Samaria.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Ahab also made the sacred pole, and {he continued to provoke}<note>Literally "Ahab added to make to provoke"</note> Yahweh the God of Israel more than all the kings of Israel who were before him.</verse>
    <verse num="34">In his days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho; at the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation, and at the cost of Segub his younger sibling, he set up its gates, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="17">
    <verse num="1">Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be dew nor rain these years {except by my command}."<note>Literally "except at the word of my mouth"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">Then the word of Yahweh came to him, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="3">"Go from this place and turn to the east; you must hide yourself in the Wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> Kerith {which faces the Jordan}.<note>Literally "on the face of the Jordan"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">It shall be that you shall drink from the wadi,<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> and I have commanded the crows to sustain you there."</verse>
    <verse num="5">So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh. He went and stayed in the Wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> Kerith {which faces the Jordan}.<note>Literally "on the face of the Jordan"</note></verse>
    <verse num="6">The crows <transChange type="added">were</transChange> bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the wadi.<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note></verse>
    <verse num="7">It happened {after a while}<note>Literally "from the end of days"</note> that the wadi<note>A seasonal stream that is often dry</note> dried up, because there was no rain in the land. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Then the word of Yahweh came to him, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">"Get up and go to Zarephath which belongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a widow, to sustain you."</verse>
    <verse num="10">So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to the gate of the city. There <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a widow woman gathering wood, so he called to her, and he said, "Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so that I can drink."</verse>
    <verse num="11">She went to fetch <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, and he called to her and said, "Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand."</verse>
    <verse num="12">She said, "{As Yahweh your God lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh your God"</note> surely I do not have a cake, {but only a handful of flour}<note>Literally "except that which fills a hand with flour"</note> in the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> gathering a few pieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we might eat it and die."</verse>
    <verse num="13">Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid. Go and do according to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first, and bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: 'The jar of flour will not be emptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh gives rain on the surface of the earth.'"</verse>
    <verse num="15">So she went and did according to the word of Elijah; then <transChange type="added">both</transChange> she and he ate with her household for many days.</verse>
    <verse num="16">The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not run out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of Elijah. </verse>
    <verse num="17">It happened after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill; and his illness was very severe until there was no breath left in him.</verse>
    <verse num="18">She said to Elijah, "{What do you have against me},<note>Literally "What for me and for you"</note> O man of God, <transChange type="added">that</transChange> you have come to me to make known my guilt and to cause my son to die?"</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then he said to her, "Give me your son." He took him from her lap and carried him up to the upper room where he was staying, and he laid him on his bed.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then he called to Yahweh and said, "O Yahweh my God, are you also causing evil to come upon the widow with whom I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> dwelling as an alien by causing her son to die?"</verse>
    <verse num="21">He stretched himself out on the child three times and called to Yahweh and said, "O Yahweh my God, please let the life of this child return within him."</verse>
    <verse num="22">Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah, and the life of the child returned within him, and he lived.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Elijah then took the child and brought him down from the upper room to the house and gave him to his mother. Elijah said, "Look, your son <transChange type="added">is</transChange> alive."</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now this I know, that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> a man of God and the word of Yahweh in your mouth <transChange type="added">is</transChange> truth." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="18">
    <verse num="1">It happened many days <transChange type="added">later</transChange> that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah in the third year, saying, "Go, present yourself to Ahab so that I may give rain on the surface of the earth."</verse>
    <verse num="2">So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine <transChange type="added">was</transChange> severe in Samaria.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Ahab summoned Obadiah who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> over the house. (Now Obadiah was fearing Yahweh greatly.</verse>
    <verse num="4">It had happened that when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them {by fifties}<note>Literally "fifty men"</note> in the cave and sustained them <transChange type="added">with</transChange> food and water.)</verse>
    <verse num="5">Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis.<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> Perhaps we may find green grass that we may keep horses and mules alive and that we might not lose any of the animals."</verse>
    <verse num="6">So they divided the land for themselves in order to pass through it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. </verse>
    <verse num="7">It happened that Obadiah <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on the way, and suddenly Elijah was there to meet him. When he recognized him, he fell on his face and said, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> this you, my lord Elijah?"</verse>
    <verse num="8">He said to him, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange>. Go, say to your lord, 'Elijah <transChange type="added">is</transChange> here.'"</verse>
    <verse num="9">He said, "How have I sinned that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me?</verse>
    <verse num="10">{As Yahweh your God lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh your God"</note> surely there is not a nation or a kingdom to which my lord has not sent me to seek you. <transChange type="added">If</transChange> they would say, 'He is not here,' then he would make the kingdom or the nation swear that it could not find you.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Now you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> saying, 'Go, say to your lord: "Elijah <transChange type="added">is</transChange> here." '</verse>
    <verse num="12">And it will happen that I will go from you and the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you up to where I do not know. Then I will come to tell Ahab, but he will not find you, and then he will kill me, <transChange type="added">even though</transChange> your servant has feared Yahweh from my youth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Has it not been told to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh? I hid a hundred men of the prophets of Yahweh {by fifties}<note>Literally "fifty fifty men"</note> in the cave, and I sustained them <transChange type="added">with</transChange> food and water.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Now you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> saying, 'Go, say to your lord: "Elijah <transChange type="added">is</transChange> here," ' and he will kill me."</verse>
    <verse num="15">Elijah said, "{As Yahweh of hosts lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh of hosts"</note> before whom I stand, I will certainly show myself to him today." </verse>
    <verse num="16">So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and he told him, so Ahab went to meet Elijah.</verse>
    <verse num="17">When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> this you <transChange type="added">who</transChange> throws Israel into confusion?"</verse>
    <verse num="18">He said, "I did not throw Israel into confusion; rather you and the house of your father <transChange type="added">have</transChange> by forsaking the commands of Yahweh when you went after the Baals!</verse>
    <verse num="19">So then, send <transChange type="added">word</transChange> and assemble all of Israel to me on Mount Carmel, with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at the table of Jezebel." </verse>
    <verse num="20">So Ahab sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> among the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> and he assembled the prophets to Mount Carmel.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Elijah approached to all the people and said, "How long <transChange type="added">will</transChange> you <transChange type="added">go</transChange> limping over two opinions? If Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> God, go after him; but if Baal, go after him." But the people did not answer him a word.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then Elijah said to the people, "I alone <transChange type="added">am</transChange> left a prophet of Yahweh, but the prophets of Baal <transChange type="added">are</transChange> four hundred and fifty men.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Let them give us two bulls, and let them choose for themselves one bull, cut him in pieces, and put it on the wood, but don't let them start a fire on it. I will prepare the other bull and set it on the wood, but I will put no fire <transChange type="added">on it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh, and it shall be that the god who answers by fire, he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> God."<note>Baal is known in Canaanite texts as being the god in control of lightning and fire</note> Then all the people answered and said, "The word <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good!" </verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the majority, and call on the name of your god, but don't set fire <transChange type="added">under it</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="26">So they took the bull that he allowed to them, prepared it, and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, "O Baal, answer us!" But there was no voice and there was no answer, so they limped<note>That is, moved about the altar in a cultic dance step</note> about the altar which they had made.</verse>
    <verse num="27">It happened at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, "Call out with a loud voice, for he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a god! Perhaps he is meditating, or {is using the bathroom},<note>Literally "has backed off for himself"</note> or <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on a journey. Perhaps he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> asleep and must wake up!"</verse>
    <verse num="28">So they called out with a loud voice, and they cut themselves with swords and with spears as was their custom, until the blood poured out over them.</verse>
    <verse num="29">It happened as noon passed, they raged until the <transChange type="added">time of</transChange> the evening offering, but there was no voice, there was no answer, and no <transChange type="added">one</transChange> paid attention. </verse>
    <verse num="30">Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come near to me," so all the people came closer to him. He repaired the altar of Yahweh <transChange type="added">that had been</transChange> destroyed.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of God came, saying, "Israel shall be your name."</verse>
    <verse num="32">With them, he built an altar in the name of Yahweh, and he made a trench {which would have held}<note>Literally "as the house of"</note> about two seahs of seed, all around the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And he arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces, and placed <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on the wood.<note>in the Hebrew Bible, 1 Kings 18:34 begins here</note> Then he said, "Fill four jars <transChange type="added">with</transChange> water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood."</verse>
    <verse num="34">He said, "Do <transChange type="added">it</transChange> again!" They did <transChange type="added">it</transChange> again. He said, "Do <transChange type="added">it</transChange> a third time!" So they did <transChange type="added">it</transChange> a third time.</verse>
    <verse num="35">The water went all around the altar, and the trench also was filled <transChange type="added">with</transChange> water. </verse>
    <verse num="36">It happened at the offering of the <transChange type="added">evening</transChange> oblation, Elijah the prophet went near, and he said, "O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; let it be known today that you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> God in Israel and <transChange type="added">that</transChange> I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> your servant and <transChange type="added">that</transChange> I have done all of these things by your words.</verse>
    <verse num="37">Answer me, O Yahweh, answer me; that this people may know that you, O Yahweh, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> God and that you have turned their hearts back again."</verse>
    <verse num="38">Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and it consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust; and the water which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the trench it licked up!</verse>
    <verse num="39">When all the people saw, they fell on their faces and said, "Yahweh, he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> God! Yahweh, he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> God!"</verse>
    <verse num="40">Then Elijah said to them, "Seize the prophets of Baal; don't let any man of them escape!" So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> of Kishon and killed them there. </verse>
    <verse num="41">Then Elijah said to Ahab, "Go up, eat and drink, for <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> the sound of the noise of rain."</verse>
    <verse num="42">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink while Elijah went to the top of Carmel, bent down to the earth, and put his face between his knees.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Then he said to his servant, "Please go <transChange type="added">and</transChange> look in the direction of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sea." So he went up and looked; then he said, "There is nothing." Then he said, "Go back," seven times.</verse>
    <verse num="44">It happened that at the seventh time, he said, "Look, there is a small cloud, as <transChange type="added">the</transChange> hand of a man, coming up from the sea." Then <transChange type="added">Elijah</transChange> said, "Go up, say to Ahab, 'Harness <transChange type="added">your horses</transChange> and go down, lest the rain stop you.'"</verse>
    <verse num="45">{In no time}<note>Literally "Until here and until here"</note> the heavens grew black <transChange type="added">with</transChange> clouds and wind, and there was heavy rain. Ahab rode and he went to Jezreel,</verse>
    <verse num="46">but the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab as one comes to Jezreel. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">Then Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "Thus may the gods do <transChange type="added">to me</transChange>, and may they add <transChange type="added">to it</transChange>, surely at this time tomorrow I will make your life as the life of one of them!"</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then he became afraid,<note>According to Greek, Syriac, and Latin manuscripts. Hebrew reads "he saw"</note> got up, and {fled for his life}.<note>Literally "he went to his life"</note> He came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Beersheba which belongs to Judah, and he left his servant there.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then he went into the wilderness one day's journey, and he went and sat under a certain broom tree. Then {he asked Yahweh that he might die},<note>Literally "he asked his life to die"</note> and he said, "It is enough now, Yahweh; take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors."<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">He lay down and fell asleep under a certain broom tree, and suddenly this angel <transChange type="added">was</transChange> touching him and said to him, "Get up, eat!"</verse>
    <verse num="6">He looked, and behold, a bread cake on hot coals <transChange type="added">was</transChange> near his head and a jar of water, so he ate and drank. Then he did it again and lay down.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The angel of Yahweh appeared a second <transChange type="added">time</transChange> and touched him and said, "Get up, eat, for the journey is greater than you."</verse>
    <verse num="8">So he got up, ate, drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights up to Horeb, the mountain of God. </verse>
    <verse num="9">He came to the cave there and spent the night there. Suddenly the <transChange type="added">word</transChange> of Yahweh came to him and asked him, "{Elijah, what are you doing here}?"<note>Literally "What is for you here, Elijah"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">Then he said, "I have been very zealous for Yahweh the God of hosts, for the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> have forsaken your covenant. They have demolished your altars, and they have killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left over, and they seek to take my life.</verse>
    <verse num="11">He<note>That is, Yahweh</note> said, "Go out and stand on the mountain before Yahweh." Suddenly Yahweh was passing by, with a great and strong wind ripping the mountains and crushing rocks before Yahweh; <transChange type="added">but</transChange> Yahweh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not in the wind. After the wind, <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> an earthquake; <transChange type="added">but</transChange> Yahweh was not in the earthquake.</verse>
    <verse num="12">After the earthquake <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a fire, <transChange type="added">but</transChange> Yahweh was not in the fire. After the fire <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> the sound of a gentle whisper.</verse>
    <verse num="13">It happened at the moment Elijah heard, he covered his face with his cloak and went out and stood <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the entrance of the cave. Suddenly a voice <transChange type="added">came</transChange> to him and said, "{Elijah, why are you here}?"<note>Literally "What is for you here, Elijah"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">He said, "I have been very zealous for Yahweh the God of Hosts, for the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> have forsaken your covenant, demolished your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword; I alone am left, and they seek to take my life!"</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Yahweh said to him, "Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. Go and anoint Hazael as king over Aram;</verse>
    <verse num="16">and Jehu son of Nimshi you shall anoint as king over Israel. You shall also anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-Meholah as prophet in your place.</verse>
    <verse num="17">It shall be that the <transChange type="added">one</transChange> who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill.</verse>
    <verse num="18">I will leave in Israel seven thousand, all of the knees that have not bowed down to Baal and all of the mouths that have not kissed him." </verse>
    <verse num="19">So he went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat while he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> plowing <transChange type="added">with</transChange> twelve pairs of oxen before him. When he and the twelve passed Elijah, he threw his cloak on him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, "Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will go after you." Then he said, "Go, return, for what I have done to you?"</verse>
    <verse num="21">So he returned from after him, and he took a pair of oxen and slaughtered them, and with the yoke of the oxen he boiled the flesh and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and served him. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered all of his army, and thirty-two kings <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, and horses and chariots. He went up and laid siege against Samaria and fought with it.</verse>
    <verse num="2">He sent messengers to the city to Ahab king of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="3">He said to him, "Thus says Ben-Hadad: 'Your silver and your gold are mine, and your women and your best sons are mine.'"</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the king of Israel answered and said, "As your word, my master the king; I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> yours, and all that is mine <transChange type="added">is yours</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="5">The messengers returned and said, "Thus says Ben-Hadad, saying, 'I sent to you saying, "Your silver and gold are mine, and your women and your best sons you must give to me."</verse>
    <verse num="6">So <transChange type="added">at this</transChange> time tomorrow, I will send my servants to you that they might search your house and the houses of your servants. All the desire of your eyes {they will lay hands on}<note>Literally "they will put in their hands"</note> and take it away.'" </verse>
    <verse num="7">Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, "Please know and realize that this <transChange type="added">man is</transChange> seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my women, my sons, my silver, and my gold, and I did not withhold <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> from him."</verse>
    <verse num="8">All of the elders and all of the people said to him, "Do not listen and do not consent."</verse>
    <verse num="9">So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, "Say to my lord the king, 'All that you demanded from your servant at the first, I will do, but this thing I am not able to do.'" Then the messengers went and {made a report to him}.<note>Literally "returned him a word"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, "Thus may the gods do to me and thus may they add if the dust of Samaria is sufficient for the hollow of a hand for all of the people who are at my feet."</verse>
    <verse num="11">The king of Israel answered and said, "Tell <transChange type="added">him</transChange>, 'Let not him who girds on his armor boast as one who takes off his armor.'"</verse>
    <verse num="12">It happened at the moment he heard this word, he and the kings <transChange type="added">were</transChange> drinking in the {tents}.<note>Literally "booths"</note> He said to his servants, "Get ready <transChange type="added">to attack</transChange>." So they got ready <transChange type="added">to attack</transChange> the city. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Suddenly a certain prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, "Thus says Yahweh: 'Have you seen all this great crowd? Behold, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> giving it into your hand today, that you may know that I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> Yahweh.'"</verse>
    <verse num="14">Ahab said, "By whom?" And he said, "Thus says Yahweh: 'By the servants of the commanders of the provinces.'" He asked, "Who will begin the battle?" And he said, "You."</verse>
    <verse num="15">So he mustered the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two. After them he mustered all of the army, all the sons of Israel, seven thousand. </verse>
    <verse num="16">They went out at noon while Ben-Hadad <transChange type="added">was</transChange> drinking <transChange type="added">himself</transChange> drunk in the tents, he and the thirty-two kings helping him.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then the servants of the commanders of the provinces went out first, and Ben-Hadad sent, and they reported to him, saying, "Men have come out from Samaria."</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then he said, "If they have come out for peace, seize them alive; and if they have come out for war, seize them alive."</verse>
    <verse num="19">But these had come out from the city, the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and the army that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> after them.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Each man killed his man, and the Arameans fled, so Israel pursued them, but Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with cavalry.</verse>
    <verse num="21">The king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and the chariots and defeated Aram with a great blow. </verse>
    <verse num="22">Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and he said to him, "Go, strengthen yourself; {consider well}<note>Literally "know and see"</note> what you should do, for the king of Aram is coming against you at the turn of the year." </verse>
    <verse num="23">The servants of the king of Aram said to him, "Their gods <transChange type="added">are</transChange> gods of the mountains, therefore they were stronger than we.<note>Hebrew "he"</note> Let us fight with them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than they.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Do this thing: remove the kings each from his post, and put a governor in their place.</verse>
    <verse num="25">You must muster an army for yourself as the army {you have lost},<note>Literally "as the army which fell from with you"</note> and horses and chariots as the horses and chariots <transChange type="added">you lost</transChange>, then we will fight them in the plain. Surely we will be stronger than they." So he listened to their voice and did so. </verse>
    <verse num="26">It happened at the turning of the year that Ben-Hadad mustered Aram and went up to Aphek for the war with Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="27">The {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> had been mustered and provisioned, and they went to engage them. The {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> encamped opposite them as two flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the land.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then the man of God approached, and he spoke to the king of Israel, and he said, "Thus says Yahweh: 'Because Aram has said, "Yahweh <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys," ' I will give all this great crowd into your hand that you may know that I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="29">These encamped opposite for seven days, and it happened on the seventh day that {the battle began},<note>Literally "the battle drew near"</note> and the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> killed the Arameans, one hundred thousand infantry in one day.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then those who remained fled to Aphek, to the city, and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who had remained, so Ben-Hadad fled and went to the innermost rooms of the city. </verse>
    <verse num="31">Then his servants said to him, "Please now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are kings of mercy. Let us now put sackcloth on around our waists and ropes on our heads. Then let us go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps {he will let you live}."<note>Literally "he may let your life live"</note></verse>
    <verse num="32">So they tied sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads. Then they went to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant Ben-Hadad says, 'Please let me live.'" And he said, "<transChange type="added">Is</transChange> my brother still alive?"</verse>
    <verse num="33">The men took this as a good omen and they quickly accepted <transChange type="added">it</transChange> as true from him, and they said, "Your brother Ben-Hadad <transChange type="added">lives</transChange>." So he said, "Go, get him." Ben-Hadad came out to him, and <transChange type="added">Ahab</transChange> pulled him up on the chariot.</verse>
    <verse num="34"><transChange type="added">Ben-Hadad</transChange> said to him, "The cities which my father took from your father I shall return. You may set up streets with stalls for yourself in Damascus just as my father set up in Samaria." <transChange type="added">Then Ahab said</transChange>, "{On these terms}<note>Literally "In covenant"</note> I will let you go," So he made a covenant with him and let him go. </verse>
    <verse num="35">A certain man from the sons of the prophets said to his fellow countryman, "By the word of Yahweh, please strike me." But the man refused to strike him. </verse>
    <verse num="36">He said to him, "Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, look, as you now are going from me, a lion will kill you." When he went from beside him, the lion found him and killed him.</verse>
    <verse num="37">Then he found another man and said, "Strike me, please," so the man struck him sharply and wounded him.</verse>
    <verse num="38">Then the prophet went and {waited}<note>Literally "stood"</note> for the king along the road and disguised himself with a<note>Hebrew "the"</note> headband over his eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="39">As the king <transChange type="added">was</transChange> passing by, he called to the king and said, "Your servant went out in the thick of the battle, and suddenly a man turned and brought a man to me and said, 'Guard this man. If by any means he should be missed, it will be your life in his place, or you shall pay a talent of silver.'</verse>
    <verse num="40">It happened that your servant {was busy here and there},<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">was</transChange> doing here and here"</note> and he {disappeared}."<note>Literally "and he was not"</note> Then the king said to him, "Your own judgment has been determined."</verse>
    <verse num="41">He quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him, that he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> from the prophets.</verse>
    <verse num="42">He said to him, "Thus says Yahweh: 'Because you have let the man I devoted for destruction go from <transChange type="added">your</transChange> hand, your life shall be in place of his life and your people in place of his people.'"</verse>
    <verse num="43">Then the king of Israel went to his house, sullen and angry, and he came to Samaria. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">It happened after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in Jezreel beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, "Give me your vineyard that it may be mine for a garden of vegetable plants, because it is near, beside my house, and I will give to you a better vineyard in place of it. If it is better in your eyes, I will give you the money of its price."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Naboth said to Ahab, "Far be it from me from Yahweh that I should give the inheritance of my ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> to you."</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Ahab went to his house, sullen and angry because of the word that Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him <transChange type="added">when</transChange> he had said, "I will not give to you the inheritance of my ancestors."<note>Or "fathers"</note> So he lay on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat <transChange type="added">any</transChange> food. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Jezebel his wife came to him, and she said to him, "What is this, that your spirit is sullen and you are not eating food?"</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then he said to her, "When I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and asked him, 'Give me your vineyard for money, or it you prefer, I will give you a vineyard in place of it,' he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"</verse>
    <verse num="7">Jezebel his wife said to him, "Now, you {rule}<note>Literally "do kingship"</note> over Israel. Get up, eat food, and let your heart be {cheerful}.<note>Literally "good"</note> I myself will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite." </verse>
    <verse num="8">So she wrote letters in the name of Ahab and sealed them with his seal. She sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> dwelling with Naboth in his city.</verse>
    <verse num="9">She had written in the letters, saying, "Call a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Seat two men, {scoundrels},<note>Literally "sons of wickedness"</note> opposite him. Let them witness against him saying, 'You cursed God and the king.' Then you shall bring him out and stone him so that he dies."</verse>
    <verse num="11">The men of his city and the elders and nobles who were living in his city did according to what Jezebel had sent to them, as <transChange type="added">was</transChange> written in the letters which she had sent to them.</verse>
    <verse num="12">They called a fast, and they seated Naboth at the head of the people.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then the two men, {scoundrels},<note>Literally "sons of wickedness"</note> came, sat opposite him, and the {scoundrels}<note>Literally "men of wickedness"</note> witnessed against Naboth before the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king," so they brought him outside of the city and stoned him with stones, and he died. </verse>
    <verse num="14">They sent to Jezebel saying, "Naboth has been stoned, and he is dead."</verse>
    <verse num="15">It happened at the moment Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and died, Jezebel said to Ahab, "Get up, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he had refused to give to you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead."</verse>
    <verse num="16">When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it. </verse>
    <verse num="17">The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="18">"Arise, go down to meet Ahab the king of Israel who is in Samaria. Look in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession of it.</verse>
    <verse num="19">You shall say to him, 'Thus says Yahweh: "Have you committed murder and also taken possession?" ' You shall also say to him, 'Thus says Yahweh: "In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, the dogs will also lick your blood." '" </verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Ahab said to Elijah, "Have you found me, my enemy?" He said, "I have found you because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="21">'Look, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> bringing disaster on you, and I will sweep away after you. I will cut off for Ahab {every male}<note>"Literally "the one who urinates against the wall"</note> in Israel, bond or free.</verse>
    <verse num="22">I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, {because you made me angry}<note>Literally "for the provocation which you have provoked"</note> and have caused Israel to sin.'</verse>
    <verse num="23">Moreover, concerning Jezebel, Yahweh has said, 'The dogs will eat Jezebel in the outer rampart of Jezreel.'</verse>
    <verse num="24">The one who dies for Ahab in the city, the dogs will eat; the one who dies in the open country, the birds of heaven will eat." </verse>
    <verse num="25">Truly, there was no one like Ahab who had sold himself by doing evil in the eyes of Yahweh, whose wife Jezebel urged him on.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Also, he acted very abominably by going after idols like all the Amorites had done whom Yahweh had driven out from before the {Israelites}."<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="27">When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth over his flesh, fasted, lay in the sackcloth, and went about dejectedly.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="29">"Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring disaster in his days. I will bring the disaster on his house in the days of his son." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">They lived three years, and there was no war between Aram and Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">It happened in the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to the king of Israel,</verse>
    <verse num="3">and the king of Israel said to his servants, "Do you know Ramoth-Gilead belongs to us, and we <transChange type="added">are</transChange> doing nothing about taking it from the hand of the king of Aram?"</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then he said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to the battle for Ramoth-Gilead?" Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "{I am like you};<note>Literally "Like I am, like you are"</note> {my people are like your people};<note>Literally "like my people, like your people"</note> {my horses are like your horses}."<note>Literally "like my horses, like your horses"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="5">Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "Please inquire for the word of Yahweh today."</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and he said to them, "Shall I go against Ramoth-Gilead for the battle, or should I refrain?" Then they said, "Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king."</verse>
    <verse num="7">So Jehoshaphat said, "Is there no prophet of Yahweh here that we might still inquire from him?"</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "<transChange type="added">There is</transChange> still one man to inquire from Yahweh, but I despise him, for he never prophesies <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> good concerning me, but only bad: Micaiah the son of Imlah." Then Jehoshaphat said, "The king should not say so."</verse>
    <verse num="9">The king of Israel summoned a certain court official, and he said, "Quickly fetch Micaiah son of Imlah."</verse>
    <verse num="10">The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah <transChange type="added">were</transChange> each sitting on his throne, dressed <transChange type="added">in their</transChange> robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> all the prophets prophesying before them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, "Thus says Yahweh: 'With these you shall gore the Arameans until finishing them.'"</verse>
    <verse num="12">All of the prophets <transChange type="added">were</transChange> likewise prophesying, saying, "Go up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Ramoth-Gilead and triumph, and Yahweh will give it into the hand of the king." </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Please now, the words of the prophet are {unanimously}<note>Literally "one mouth"</note> favorable to the king. Please let your words be as one word with them, and speak favorably."</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Micaiah said, "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "The life of Yahweh"</note> surely only as Yahweh speaks to me, that will I speak."</verse>
    <verse num="15">When he came to the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to the battle, or shall we refrain?" He said to him, "Go up and triumph, and Yahweh will give <transChange type="added">it</transChange> into the hand of the king."</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then the king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear that you shall not tell me <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> but truth in the name of Yahweh?"</verse>
    <verse num="17">So he said, "I saw all of Israel scattering to the mountains, like the sheep without a shepherd. Yahweh also said, 'There are no masters for these, let them return in peace, each to his house.'"</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not say to you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but disaster?" </verse>
    <verse num="19">And he<note>That is, Micaiah</note> said, "Therefore, hear the word of Yahweh. I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne with all the hosts of heaven standing beside him from his right hand and from his left <transChange type="added">hand</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Yahweh said, 'Who will entice Ahab so that he will go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?' Then {this one was saying one thing and the other one was saying another}.<note>Literally "this one said in thus and this one was saying in thus"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">Then a spirit came out and stood before Yahweh and said, 'I will entice him,' and Yahweh said to him, 'How?'</verse>
    <verse num="22">He said, 'I will go out and I will be a false spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And he<note>That is, Yahweh</note> said, 'You shall entice and succeed, go out and do so.'</verse>
    <verse num="23">So then, see that Yahweh has placed a false spirit in the mouth of all of these your prophets, and Yahweh has spoken disaster concerning you." </verse>
    <verse num="24">Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah came near and slapped Micaiah on the cheek and said, "When did the Spirit of Yahweh pass from me to speak with you?"</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Micaiah said, "Behold, you <transChange type="added">are about to</transChange> see on that day when you go {from room to room}<note>Literally "private room in private room"</note> to hide."</verse>
    <verse num="26">The king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the commander of the city and to Jehoash the son of the king;</verse>
    <verse num="27">and say, 'Thus says the king: "Put this <transChange type="added">fellow in</transChange> the house of imprisonment and feed him reduced rations of food and water until I come in peace." '"</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then Micaiah said, "If you indeed return in peace, then Yahweh has not spoken with me." Then he said, "Let all the peoples hear!" </verse>
    <verse num="29">Then the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Ramoth-Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "<transChange type="added">I will</transChange> disguise myself and go into the battle, but you wear your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and he went into the battle.</verse>
    <verse num="31">The king of Aram commanded his thirty-two chariot commanders, saying, "You shall not fight with small or great, but only against the king of Israel, him alone!"</verse>
    <verse num="32">When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "Surely he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the king of Israel," and they turned to fight against him, so Jehoshaphat called out.</verse>
    <verse num="33">When the chariot commanders saw that it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not the king of Israel, they turned away from him.</verse>
    <verse num="34">But another man drew his bow fully and struck the king of Israel between the armor scales and the breastplate; so he said to his chariot driver, "Turn {the chariot}<note>Literally "your hand"</note> and bring me out from the camp, for I am wounded." </verse>
    <verse num="35">The battle intensified on that day, and the king was being propped up in the chariot opposite Aram, but he died in the evening, and the blood of the wound ran out to the floor of the chariot.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then the shout passed through the camp about sunset, saying, "Each man to his city and each to his land!"</verse>
    <verse num="37">So the king died, and {they brought him}<note>Literally "and he went"</note> to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.</verse>
    <verse num="38">They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked his blood (now, the prostitutes washed themselves <transChange type="added">there</transChange>) according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken.</verse>
    <verse num="39">The remainder of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and the ivory palace and all the cities that he built, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel?</verse>
