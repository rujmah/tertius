    <verse num="11">And the word of Yahweh came to me, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note> "What <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you seeing, Jeremiah?" And I said, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> seeing a branch of an almond tree."</verse>

    <verse num="2">"Thus says Yahweh, 'The <transChange type="added">one who</transChange> stays in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague. But the <transChange type="added">one who</transChange> goes out to the Chaldeans will live. And his life will be for him as booty, and he will live.'</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thus says Yahweh, 'Surely this city will be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.'" </verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the officials said to the king, "Please, this man must be killed, {because}<note>Literally "unto thus"</note> he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> making slack the hands of {the soldiers}<note>Literally "the men of the war"</note> who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking to them words like these, for this man <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not seeking for welfare<note>Or "peace"</note> to this people, {but only}<note>Literally "but if"</note> for harm."</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Zedekiah the king said, "Look, he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in your hand, for the king is not able <transChange type="added">to do</transChange> a thing against you."</verse>
    <verse num="6">So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit<note>Or "cistern"</note> <transChange type="added">of</transChange> Malchiah, the son of the king, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the courtyard of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down by ropes. Now in the pit<note>Or "cistern"</note> there was no water,<note>Hebrew "waters"</note> {but only}<note>Literally "but if"</note> mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud. </verse>
    <verse num="7">When Ebed-melech the Cushite, {a eunuch}<note>Literally "a man of a eunuch"</note> who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> in the house of the king, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the pit<note>Or "cistern"</note>--now the king <transChange type="added">was</transChange> sitting at the Gate of Benjamin--</verse>
    <verse num="8">Ebed-melech went out from the house of the king and spoke to the king, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">"My lord the king, these men have done evil <transChange type="added">in</transChange> all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, <transChange type="added">in</transChange> that they have thrown <transChange type="added">him</transChange> into the pit,<note>Or "cistern"</note> and he will die {there}<note>Literally "in it"</note> {because of}<note>Literally "from the face of"</note> starvation, for there is no longer any bread in the city."</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note> "Take {with you}<note>Literally "in your hand"</note> these thirty men and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the pit<note>Or "cistern"</note> {before}<note>Literally "at not yet"</note> he dies." </verse>
    <verse num="11">So Ebed-melech took the men {with him}<note>Literally "in his hand"</note> and went <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the palace of the king, to <transChange type="added">a place</transChange> beneath the storehouse, and he took from there {rags}<note>Literally "the rags of rags"</note> and {worn-out clothes}.<note>Literally "rags of ragged clothes"</note> And he let them down into the pit<note>Or "cistern"</note> by ropes to Jeremiah.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, "Please put {the rags}<note>Literally "rags of the rags"</note> and {worn-out clothes}<note>Literally "ragged clothes"</note> under the joints of your arms under the ropes," and Jeremiah did so.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And they pulled Jeremiah by the ropes and brought him up from the pit.<note>Or "cistern"</note> And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard. </verse>
    <verse num="14">And Zedekiah the king sent and made someone bring Jeremiah the prophet to him, to <transChange type="added">the</transChange> third entrance that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> at the {temple}<note>Literally "house"</note> of Yahweh. And the king said to Jeremiah, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> asking you {something},<note>Literally "a thing"</note> you must not hide {anything}<note>Literally "a thing"</note> from me."</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, will you not surely kill me? {Besides},<note>Literally "And"</note> if I advise you, you will not listen to me.</verse>
    <verse num="16">So Zedekiah the king swore to Jeremiah in secret, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note> "{As Yahweh lives},<note>Literally "Life of Yahweh"</note> who has made for us this life, I will not kill you and I will not give you into the hand of these men who are seeking your life." </verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, 'If only you will go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then {you}<note>Literally "your life" or "your soul"</note> will live, and this city will not be burned with fire, and you will live, you and your house.</verse>
    <verse num="18">But if you <transChange type="added">do</transChange> not go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape from their hand.'" </verse>
    <verse num="19">And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, "I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hand and they abuse me."</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Jeremiah said, "They will not give <transChange type="added">you over</transChange>. Please obey the voice of Yahweh with regard to what I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> saying to you, and it will go well with you, and {you}<note>Literally "your life" or "your soul"</note> will live.</verse>
    <verse num="21">But if you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> refusing to surrender, this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the thing that Yahweh has shown me.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Now look, all the women who remain in the house of the king of Judah <transChange type="added">are</transChange> being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon. And look, <transChange type="added">they are</transChange> saying, </verse>
    <verse num="23">And all your wives and your children <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> led out to the Chaldeans, and you will not escape from their hand, but by the hand of the king of Babylon you will be seized, and this city will burn with fire." </verse>
    <verse num="24">And Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "No man must know about these words so that you will not die.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And if the officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you, 'Please tell us what you said to the king. You must not conceal <transChange type="added">it</transChange> from us so that we will not kill you. And what did the king say to you?'</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then you shall say to them, 'I <transChange type="added">was</transChange> presenting my plea {before}<note>Literally "to the face of"</note> the king, to not cause me to return <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the house of Jonathan to die there.'"</verse>
    <verse num="27">And all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he informed them like all these words that the king commanded. So they fell silent, for the {conversation}<note>Literally "word"</note> was not heard.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard until <transChange type="added">the</transChange> day that Jerusalem was captured. And it happened that Jerusalem was captured.<note>Jeremiah 38:28b in the Hebrew Bible is 39:1a in the English Bible</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="39">
    <verse num="1">In the ninth year of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it.</verse>
    <verse num="2">In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on <transChange type="added">the</transChange> ninth <transChange type="added">day</transChange> of the month, the city was taken by assault.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim <transChange type="added">the</transChange> chief officer, Nergal-sharezer <transChange type="added">the</transChange> high official, with all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="4">{And then}<note>Literally "And it was"</note> {when}<note>Literally "as that"</note> Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all {the soldiers}<note>Literally "the men of the war"</note> <transChange type="added">with him</transChange>, they fled and went out <transChange type="added">at</transChange> night from the city <transChange type="added">by</transChange> the way of the garden of the king through <transChange type="added">the</transChange> gate between the walls. And they went out toward the Jordan Valley.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But the army of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Chaldeans pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And they took him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Riblah in the land of Hamath. And he pronounced {sentence}<note>Literally "judgments"</note> on him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and tied him up with bronze fetters to bring him <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the Chaldeans burned the palace<note>Or "house"</note> of the king and the houses<note>Hebrew "house"</note> of the people with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Then the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those deserting who had deserted to him, and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> captain of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> guard,<note>Hebrew "guards"</note> deported <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And some of the poor people, {who had nothing},<note>Literally "who there was not for them something"</note> Nebuzaradan, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> captain of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> guard,<note>Hebrew "guards"</note> left in the land of Judah. And he gave them vineyards and fields on that day. </verse>
    <verse num="11">And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon commanded concerning Jeremiah {through}<note>Literally "in the hand of"</note> Nebuzaradan, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> captain of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> guard,<note>Hebrew "guards"</note> {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">"Take him and set your eyes on him. And you must not do something bad to him, {but only}<note>Literally "but if"</note> that which he speaks to you, so do with him."</verse>
    <verse num="13">So Nebuzaradan, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> captain of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> guard,<note>Hebrew "guards"</note> sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange>, {along with}<note>Literally "and"</note> Nebushazban <transChange type="added">the</transChange> chief officer, and Nergal-sharezer <transChange type="added">the</transChange> high official, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they sent and took Jeremiah from the courtyard of the guard and gave him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him to the house, so he stayed in the midst of the people. </verse>
    <verse num="15">And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah at his confinement in the courtyard of the guard, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note></verse>
    <verse num="16">"Go and say to Ebed-melech the Cushite, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note> 'Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: "Look, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> about to bring my words to pass against this city for evil and not for good. And they will be {before you}<note>Literally "to the face of you"</note> on that day.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But I will rescue you on that day," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh, "and you will not be given into the hand of the men {of whom you are frightened}.<note>Literally "who you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> frightened from the face of them"</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">For surely I will save you, and you will not fall by the sword. But your life will be for you as booty because you have trusted in me," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.'" </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="40">
    <verse num="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> captain of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> guard,<note>Hebrew "guards"</note> had let him go from Ramah, {where he had been taken}<note>Literally "at his taking him</note> bound in chains in the midst of all the exiles<note>Hebrew "exile"</note> of Jerusalem and Judah who were being deported <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And <transChange type="added">the</transChange> captain of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> guard<note>Hebrew "guards"</note> took Jeremiah and said to him, "Yahweh your God threatened this disaster to this place,</verse>
    <verse num="3">and <transChange type="added">now</transChange> he has brought <transChange type="added">it about</transChange>,<note>Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> and Yahweh has done {just as}<note>Literally "as that"</note> he threatened. Because you sinned against Yahweh and did not listen to his voice, so this thing <transChange type="added">has</transChange> happened to you.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And so then look, I have released you {today}<note>Literally "the day"</note> from the chains that <transChange type="added">were</transChange> on your hands.<note>Hebrew "hand"</note> If it is good in your eyes to come with me <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Babylon, <transChange type="added">then</transChange> come, and {I will take care of you}.<note>Literally "I will place my eye on you"</note> But if it is bad in your eyes to come with me <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Babylon, <transChange type="added">then</transChange> refrain. Look, the whole land <transChange type="added">is</transChange> {before you}.<note>Literally "to the face of you"</note> To <transChange type="added">wherever it is</transChange> good and right in your eyes to go, <transChange type="added">then</transChange> go there."</verse>
    <verse num="5">While he still had not turned back, <transChange type="added">Nebuzaradan</transChange> added, "Return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed <transChange type="added">in an official position</transChange> over the towns of Judah, and stay with him in the midst of the people. Or to <transChange type="added">wherever it is</transChange> right in your eyes to go, <transChange type="added">then</transChange> go <transChange type="added">there</transChange>."<note>Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> Then <transChange type="added">the</transChange> captain of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> guard<note>Hebrew "guards"</note> gave him an allowance of provisions and a present, and let him go.</verse>
    <verse num="6">So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Mizpah and stayed with him in the midst of the people who were left in the land. </verse>
    <verse num="7">When all the commanders of the armies who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam <transChange type="added">in an official position</transChange> in the land, and that {he had put him in charge of}<note>Literally "he had appointed to him"</note> men, and women, and little children, and of the poor of the land, of <transChange type="added">all those</transChange> who had not been deported <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Babylon,</verse>
    <verse num="8">then they went to Gedaliah <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Mizpah--Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan, and Jehonathan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note> "You must not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.</verse>
    <verse num="10">{As for me},<note>Literally "And I"</note> look, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> staying at Mizpah to represent <transChange type="added">you</transChange> {before}<note>Literally "to the face of"</note> the Chaldeans who come to us. But you, gather wine and summer fruit and oil, and put <transChange type="added">them</transChange> in your vessels, and live in your towns that you have seized."</verse>
    <verse num="11">And also all the Judeans who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in Moab, and among the {Ammonites},<note>Literally "sons of Ammon"</note> and in Edom, and who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in all the lands, <transChange type="added">when</transChange> they heard that the king of Babylon had given a remnant to Judah and that he had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, <transChange type="added">in an official position</transChange> over them,</verse>
    <verse num="12">then all the Judeans returned from all the places <transChange type="added">to</transChange> which they were scattered. And they came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the land of Judah, to Gedaliah <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Mizpah, and they gathered wine and summer fruit that yielded {in great abundance}.<note>Literally "very numerous"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="13">And Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in the open country came to Gedaliah <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Mizpah</verse>
    <verse num="14">and said to him, "{Are you at all aware}<note>Literally "know you know"</note> that Baalis, the king of the {Ammonites},<note>Literally "sons of Ammon"</note> has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, to kill you?" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Johanan the son of Kareah said to Gedaliah in secrecy at Mizpah, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note> "Please let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and {nobody}<note>Literally "not a man"</note> will know. Why should he kill you, so that all of Judah who are gathered to you will be scattered, and the remnant of Judah will perish?"</verse>
    <verse num="16">But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, "You must not do this thing, for you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> telling a lie about Ishmael." </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="41">
    <verse num="1">{And then}<note>Literally "And it was"</note> in the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, from the offspring of the kingship, and <transChange type="added">one of</transChange> the chief officers of the king, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Mizpah, {along with}<note>Literally "and"</note> ten men. And they ate bread together there at Mizpah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah got up, {along with}<note>Literally "and"</note> the ten men who were with him, and they struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and killed him whom the king of Babylon had appointed <transChange type="added">in an official position</transChange> over the land.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Ishmael killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, {along with}<note>Literally "and"</note> the Chaldeans who were found there, {the soldiers}.<note>Literally "the men of the war"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="4">{And then}<note>Literally "And it was"</note> on the second day of the killing of Gedaliah--and {no one}<note>Literally "not a man"</note> knew--</verse>
    <verse num="5">then men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men <transChange type="added">with</transChange> shaven beards<note>Hebrew "beard"</note> and torn garments, <transChange type="added">who had</transChange> cut themselves with blades, {having}<note>Literally "and"</note> grain offerings<note>Hebrew "grain offering"</note> and frankincense in their hands<note>Hebrew "hand"</note> to bring <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the {temple}<note>Literally "house"</note> of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out to meet them from Mizpah, {weeping as he came}.<note>Literally "coming he came and weeping"</note> {And then}<note>Literally "And it was"</note> as <transChange type="added">he was</transChange> meeting them, he said to them, "Come to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam."</verse>
    <verse num="7">{And then},<note>Literally "And it was"</note> the moment of their coming to the middle of the city, then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, {along with}<note>Literally "and"</note> the men who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, slaughtered<note>The Hebrew verb is singular</note> them <transChange type="added">and threw them</transChange> to the middle of the pit.<note>Or "cistern"</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">But ten men were found among them, and they said to Ishmael, "You must not kill us, for {we have}<note>Literally "there is to us"</note> hidden treasures in the field, wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey.

    <verse num="9">Now the pit<note>Or "cistern"</note> <transChange type="added">into</transChange> which Ishmael threw all the corpses of the men whom he had killed {along with}<note>Literally "by the hand of"</note> Gedaliah <transChange type="added">was the same one</transChange> that King Asa had made because of Baasha the king of Israel, <transChange type="added">who was</transChange> against him. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled <transChange type="added">it with</transChange> the slain ones. </verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in Mizpah, the daughters of the king and all the people who were left at Mizpah, <transChange type="added">over</transChange> whom Nebuzaradan, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> captain of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> guard,<note>Hebrew "guards"</note> had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

    <verse num="11">When Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, heard<note>The Hebrew verb is singular</note> all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</verse>

    <verse num="13">{And then},<note>Literally "And it was"</note> the moment that all the people who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him, they were glad.</verse>
    <verse num="14">So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and returned and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.</verse>

    <verse num="16">Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, strong men, {soldiers},<note>Literally "the men of the war"</note> and women, and little children, and eunuchs whom he brought back from Gibeon.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And they set out and stayed at the lodging place of Chimham that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> near Bethlehem, {intending}<note>Literally "going"</note> to go <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Egypt</verse>

    <verse num="2">and said to Jeremiah the prophet, "May our plea please fall {before you},<note>Literally "to the face of you"</note> and pray for us to Yahweh your God, for all this remnant, for we are left <transChange type="added">but</transChange> a few of many, as your eyes <transChange type="added">are</transChange> seeing us.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Concerning Moab, thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: </verse>
    <verse num="2">The glory of Moab is no longer. In Heshbon they planned evil against her. Come and let us cut her off from <transChange type="added">being</transChange> a nation. Also, Madmen, you will be silent. After you will go <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sword.</verse>
    <verse num="3"><transChange type="added">The</transChange> sound of a cry of distress <transChange type="added">arises</transChange> from Horonaim, devastation and great destruction.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Moab is broken, her little ones {make heard}<note>Literally "cause to hear"</note> a cry for help.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For the ascent of Luhith, in weeping they go weeping, For on the slope of Horonaim they have heard <transChange type="added">the</transChange> distresses of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> cry of distress of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> destruction.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Flee! Save your life! {For}<note>Literally "And"</note> you must not be like the juniper tree in the desert.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For because of your trusting in your works and in your treasures, even you yourselves will be taken, and Chemosh will go out into the exile, his priests and his officials together.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And <transChange type="added">the</transChange> destroyer will come to every town, and a town will not escape. And the valley will be destroyed, and the plain will be destroyed, as Yahweh has spoken.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Give salt for Moab, for certainly she will go to ruin, and her towns will become as a desolation, {without}<note>Literally "from there is not"</note> an inhabitant in them.</verse>
    <verse num="10"><transChange type="added">The one who</transChange> does the work of Yahweh <transChange type="added">with</transChange> slackness <transChange type="added">is</transChange> cursed, and <transChange type="added">the one who</transChange> keeps away blood from his sword <transChange type="added">is</transChange> cursed.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has been quiet on his dregs, and he has not been poured out from vessel to vessel, and he has not gone into exile. {Therefore}<note>Literally "Unto thus"</note> his taste has remained unchanged, and his fragrance has not changed.</verse>
    <verse num="12">{Therefore}<note>Literally "To thus"</note> look, days <transChange type="added">are</transChange> coming," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh, "and I will send to him {decanters},<note>Literally "those who tilt"</note> and they will decant him, and his vessels they will empty out, and their jars they will smash.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel were ashamed of Bethel, their trust.</verse>
    <verse num="14">How can you say, 'we <transChange type="added">are</transChange> warriors, and men of might for the battle.'</verse>
    <verse num="15">Moab is destroyed, and his towns have gone up, and the choice of his young men have gone down to the slaughtering," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> the King, Yahweh of hosts <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his name.</verse>
    <verse num="16">"The disaster of Moab <transChange type="added">is</transChange> near to come, and his disaster {approaches very quickly}.<note>Literally "hastens greatly"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">Mourn for him, all his surroundings, and all those who knew his name. Say, 'How <transChange type="added">the</transChange> staff of might is broken, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> staff of glory.'</verse>
    <verse num="18">Come down from glory and sit on the parched ground, O inhabitant, daughter of Dibon, for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you, he has destroyed your fortifications.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Stand by <transChange type="added">the</transChange> road and watch, O inhabitant of Aroer. Ask <transChange type="added">the man who is</transChange> fleeing and <transChange type="added">the woman who is</transChange> escaping, say, 'What has happened?'</verse>
    <verse num="20">Moab is ashamed, for it is filled with terror. Wail and cry out, tell <transChange type="added">it</transChange> by Arnon that Moab is devastated.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Judgment has also come to the land of the plain, to Holon, and to Jahaz, and on Mephaath,</verse>
    <verse num="22">and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth-diblathaim,</verse>
    <verse num="23">and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth-gamul, and on Beth-meon,</verse>
    <verse num="24">and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the towns of the land of Moab, the far and the near.</verse>
    <verse num="25">The horn of Moab is cut off and his arm is broken," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh. </verse>
    <verse num="26">"Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against Yahweh, and let Moab wallow in his vomit. And he also will become a laughingstock.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Now <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not Israel the laughingstock to you? Or was he found among thieves? For {as often as}<note>Literally "from enough"</note> you spoke over him you shook <transChange type="added">your head</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Leave <transChange type="added">the</transChange> towns and dwell on the rock, O inhabitants of Moab, and be like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> dove, it nests on <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sides of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mouth of a ravine.</verse>
    <verse num="29">We have heard <transChange type="added">of</transChange> the pride of Moab --<transChange type="added">he is</transChange> very proud-- his height, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.</verse>
    <verse num="30">I know his insolence," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh, "and his boastings <transChange type="added">are</transChange> {false};<note>Literally "not right"</note> they act {falsely}.<note>Literally "not right"</note></verse>
    <verse num="31">{Therefore}<note>Literally "Unto thus"</note> over Moab I wail, and for all of Moab I cry out, for the people<note>Or "men"</note> of Kir-heres I moan.</verse>
    <verse num="32">More than the weeping of Jazer I weep for you, O vine Sibmah. Your branches cross over <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sea, up to the sea of Jazer they reach. Upon your summer fruit and upon your vintage <transChange type="added">the</transChange> destroyer has fallen.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And joy and rejoicing have been taken away from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> fruitful land, even from the land of Moab. And <transChange type="added">the</transChange> wine from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> wine presses I have caused to disappear. He will not tread <transChange type="added">with</transChange> exuberant shouts.<note>Hebrew "exuberant shout"</note> Exuberant shouts<note>Hebrew "Exuberant shout"</note> <transChange type="added">will</transChange> not <transChange type="added">be</transChange> exuberant shouts.<note>Hebrew "exuberant shout"</note></verse>
    <verse num="34">From the cry for help of Heshbon, up to Elealeh, up to Jahaz, they give their voice, from Zoar up to Horonaim, <transChange type="added">up to</transChange> Eglath-shelishiyah, for even the waters of Nimrim have become as a desolation.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And I will cause to disappear for Moab," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh, "<transChange type="added">the</transChange> one who presents a sacrifice <transChange type="added">at</transChange> a high place, and <transChange type="added">the one who</transChange> burns a smoke offering to his gods.</verse>
    <verse num="36">{Therefore}<note>Literally "Unto thus"</note> my heart moans for Moab like the flute.<note>Hebrew "flutes"</note> It moans for the people<note>Or "men"</note> of Kir-heres like the flute.<note>Hebrew "flutes"</note> {Therefore}<note>Literally "Unto thus"</note> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> wealth they gained has perished.</verse>
    <verse num="37">For <transChange type="added">on</transChange> every head <transChange type="added">is</transChange> baldness, and every beard is trimmed. On all <transChange type="added">the</transChange> hands, slashes, and on <transChange type="added">the</transChange> loins, sackcloth.</verse>
    <verse num="38">On all the roofs of Moab, and in its public squares, <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> wailing everywhere. For I have broken Moab like a vessel, there is no delight in it," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="39">"How it is filled with terror! <transChange type="added">How</transChange> they wail! How Moab has turned <transChange type="added">his</transChange> back! He is disgraced! So Moab has become as a derision, and as a terror for all his surrounding <transChange type="added">peoples</transChange>."</verse>
    <verse num="40">For thus says Yahweh, </verse>
    <verse num="41">Kerioth will be taken, and the strongholds will be conquered, and the hearts<note>Hebrew "heart"</note> of the warriors of Moab will be on that day like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> heart of a woman <transChange type="added">who</transChange> is in labor.</verse>
    <verse num="42">And Moab will be destroyed from <transChange type="added">being</transChange> a people, because against Yahweh he magnified himself.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Dread, and pit, and a trapping net <transChange type="added">are</transChange> against you, O inhabitant of Moab," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="44">"He <transChange type="added">who</transChange> flees {before}<note>Literally "from the face of"</note> the dread will fall into the pit, and the <transChange type="added">one who</transChange> climbs up from the pit will be caught in the trapping net, for I will bring on Moab the year of their punishment," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="45">"In the shadow of Heshbon fugitives stand without strength, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, and a flame from Sihon. And it has eaten the forehead of Moab, and the skulls<note>Hebrew "skull"</note> of the people<note>Or "sons"</note> of tumult.</verse>
    <verse num="46">Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished. For your sons have been taken into captivity, and your daughters into captivity.</verse>
    <verse num="47">Yet I will restore the fortunes<note>Hebrew "fortune"</note> of Moab in the last of the days," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>

  <chapter num="49">
    <verse num="1">Concerning the {Ammonites}:<note>Literally "sons of Ammon"</note> Thus says Yahweh, </verse>
    <verse num="2">{Therefore}<note>Literally "To thus"</note> look, days <transChange type="added">are</transChange> coming," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh, "and I will sound against Rabbah, the {Ammonites},<note>Literally "sons of Ammon"</note> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> alarm of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> war, and it will become as a mound of desolation, and its daughters will burn in the fire. Then Israel will dispossess his dispossessors," says Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="3">"Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is devastated. Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah, put on sackcloth. Lament and run back and forth among the walls. For Milcom will go into exile, his priests and his officials together.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Why do you boast in <transChange type="added">your</transChange> valleys? Your valleys<note>Hebrew "valley"</note> <transChange type="added">are</transChange> ebbing. O unfaithful daughter, who trusted in her treasures, <transChange type="added">who said</transChange>, 'Who will come against me?'</verse>
    <verse num="5">Look, I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> going to bring dread on you," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Lord Yahweh of hosts, "from all your surrounding <transChange type="added">neighbors</transChange>. And you will be scattered, each one {before it},<note>Literally "to the face of it"</note> and there is no <transChange type="added">one who</transChange> gathers the fugitives.<note>Hebrew "fugitive"</note></verse>
    <verse num="6">Yet {afterward}<note>Literally "after thus"</note> I will restore the fortunes<note>Hebrew "fortune"</note> of the {Ammonites},"<note>Literally "sons of Ammon"</note> {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Concerning Edom, thus says Yahweh of hosts: </verse>
    <verse num="8">Flee! Turn back! {Get down low}!<note>Literally "make deep to dwell"</note> O inhabitants of Dedan. For I will bring upon him the disaster of Esau <transChange type="added">at the</transChange> time <transChange type="added">when</transChange> I will punish him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">If grape-gatherers come to you, would they not leave gleanings? If thieves in the night, they destroy <transChange type="added">only</transChange> {enough for them}.<note>Literally "their enough"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">But I have stripped Esau bare. I have uncovered his hiding places, and he is not able to hide himself. His offspring are devastated, {along with}<note>Literally "and"</note> his brothers, and his neighbors, and {he is no more}.<note>Literally "and not he"</note></verse>
    <verse num="11">Leave your orphans. I will let <transChange type="added">them</transChange><note>Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> live. And your widows, let them trust in me."</verse>
    <verse num="12">For thus says Yahweh, "Look, those {who are not condemned}<note>Literally "who there is not their justice"</note> to drink the cup must certainly drink <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.<note>Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> And <transChange type="added">are</transChange> you the one who will go entirely unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for you must certainly drink <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.<note>Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note></verse>
    <verse num="13">For I have sworn by myself," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh, "that Bozrah will become as a horror, as a disgrace, as a waste, and as a curse. And all her towns will be {everlasting sites of ruins}."<note>Literally "sites of ruins of eternity"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="14">I have heard a message from Yahweh, and a messenger has been sent among the nations. "Gather and come against her, and rise for the battle."</verse>
    <verse num="15">"For look, I will make you small among the nations, despised by the humankind.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Your terror has deceived you, the pride of your heart, <transChange type="added">O you who</transChange> dwell in the clefts of the rock, <transChange type="added">you who</transChange> seize <transChange type="added">the</transChange> height of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> hill. Though you make your nest high like the eagle, from there I will bring you down," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="17">"And Edom will become as a horror, {everyone who passes by it}<note>Literally "all <transChange type="added">who</transChange> passes by it"</note> will be appalled, and will hiss because of all its blows.</verse>
    <verse num="18">As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors," says Yahweh, "{no one}<note>Literally "not a man"</note> will live there, and the son of humankind will not dwell as an alien in it.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Look, like a lion he comes up from the thickets of the Jordan to {a pastureland by a constantly flowing stream}.<note>Literally "a pasture of everflowing"</note> So {I will chase him away hurriedly}<note>Literally "I will do in an instant I will chase him away"</note> from it. And whoever <transChange type="added">is</transChange> chosen I will appoint over it. For who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like me, and who can summon me? And who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> shepherd who can stand {before me}?"<note>Literally "to the face of me"</note></verse>
    <verse num="20">{Therefore}<note>Literally "To thus"</note> hear the plan of Yahweh that he has planned against Edom, and his plans that he has planned against the inhabitants of Teman. {Surely}<note>Literally "If not"</note> they will drag them away, the little <transChange type="added">ones</transChange> of the flock. {Surely}<note>Literally "If not"</note> he will cause to be desolated over them their grazing place.</verse>
    <verse num="21">The earth will quake from the sound of their falling. A cry of distress! Their voice will be heard at {the Red Sea}.<note>Hebrew "Sea of Reeds"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">Look, like an eagle he will go up and he will swoop down, and he will spread out his wings against Bozrah. And the heart of the warriors of Edom will be in that day like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> heart of a woman <transChange type="added">who</transChange> is in labor.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Concerning Damascus: </verse>
    <verse num="24">Damascus has grown slack. She has turned away to flee and panic. Anxiety has seized <transChange type="added">her</transChange>, and labor pains have grasped her, like a woman in labor.</verse>
    <verse num="25">How <transChange type="added">the</transChange> city of praise has not been abandoned! The city of my joy!</verse>
    <verse num="26">{Therefore}<note>Literally "To thus"</note> her young men will fall in her public squares, and all {the soldiers}<note>Literally "the men of the battle"</note> will perish in that day," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="27">"And I will kindle a fire at the wall of Damascus, and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Ben-hadad."</verse>
    <verse num="28">Concerning Kedar and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon defeated. Thus says Yahweh: </verse>
    <verse num="29">They will take their tents, and their flocks, their tent curtains, and all their equipment, and their camels they will carry away for themselves, and they will call to them, 'Terror <transChange type="added">is</transChange> from all around.'</verse>

And I will scatter to every wind <transChange type="added">those who</transChange> are trimmed to <transChange type="added">the</transChange> side, and from {every side}<note>Literally "all his sides"</note> I will bring their disaster," {declares}<note>Literally "a declaration of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="33">"And Hazor will become as a lair of jackals, a waste forever; no one will live there, and no son of humankind will dwell as an alien in it."</verse>
    <verse num="34">The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the king of Judah, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note></verse>

    <verse num="37">So I will shatter Elam {before}<note>Literally "to the face of"</note> their enemies, and {before}<note>Literally "to the face of"</note> the seekers of their life.
