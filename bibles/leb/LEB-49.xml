    <verse num="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus<note>A number of the earliest and most important manuscripts omit "in Ephesus," though it is hard to make sense of the line without this phrase (cf. rsv, "to the saints who are also faithful")</note> and faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>

    <verse num="3">Blessed <transChange type="added">is</transChange><note>Or "blessed <transChange type="added">be</transChange>"</note> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly <transChange type="added">places</transChange> in Christ,</verse>

    <verse num="1">And you, {although you were dead}<note>Literally "and you being dead"</note><note>*Here the participle ("being") is understood as concessive</note> in your trespasses and sins,</verse>
    <verse num="2">in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit now working in the sons of disobedience,</verse>
    <verse num="3">among whom also we all formerly lived in the desires of our flesh, doing the will<note>Or "desires"</note> of the flesh and of the mind, and we were children of wrath<note>This phrase is a Semitic idiom which can mean either (1) "children characterized by wrath" or (2) "children destined for wrath"</note> by nature, as also the rest of <transChange type="added">them</transChange> were. </verse>
    <verse num="4">But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love <transChange type="added">with</transChange> which he loved us,</verse>

    <verse num="7">in order that he might show in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness upon us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For by grace you are saved through faith, and this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not from yourselves, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> the gift of God;</verse>
    <verse num="9"><transChange type="added">it is</transChange> not from works, so that no one can boast.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For we are his creation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, so that we may walk in them. </verse>

    <verse num="12">that you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, not having hope, and without God in the world.</verse>
    <verse num="13">But now in Christ Jesus you, the ones who once were far away, have become near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For he himself is our peace, who made both one and broke down the dividing wall of the partition, the enmity, in his flesh,</verse>
    <verse num="15">invalidating the law of commandments in ordinances, in order that he might create the two in himself into one new man, <transChange type="added">thus</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">thus</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("making") which is understood as result</note> making peace,</verse>

    <verse num="17">And coming, he proclaimed the good news of peace to you who were far away and peace to the ones who were near,</verse>
    <verse num="18">because through him <transChange type="added">we</transChange> both have access in one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Consequently, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God,</verse>
    <verse num="20">built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,<note>Or perhaps "capstone"</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">in whom the whole building, joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord,</verse>

    <verse num="1">On account of this I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles</verse>

    <verse num="3">According to<note>Some manuscripts have "given to me for you, that according to"</note> revelation the mystery was made known to me, just as I wrote beforehand in brief,</verse>
    <verse num="4">so that you may be able when you read<note>Or "by reading"</note> to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ</verse>
    <verse num="5">(which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit):</verse>
    <verse num="6"><transChange type="added">that</transChange> the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,</verse>
    <verse num="7">of which I became a servant, according to the gift of God's grace given to me, according to the working of his power. </verse>
    <verse num="8">To me, the least of all the saints, was given this grace: to proclaim the good news of the fathomless riches of Christ to the Gentiles,</verse>
    <verse num="9">and to enlighten everyone <transChange type="added">as to</transChange> what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the administration of the mystery hidden from the ages by God, who created all <transChange type="added">things</transChange>,</verse>

    <verse num="13">Therefore I ask <transChange type="added">you</transChange><note>*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> not to be discouraged at my afflictions on behalf of you, which are your glory. </verse>

    <verse num="17"><transChange type="added">that</transChange> Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith (you having been firmly rooted and established in love),</verse>

  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to live in a manner worthy of the calling with which you were called:</verse>
    <verse num="2">with all humility and gentleness, with patience, putting up with one another in love,</verse>
    <verse num="3">being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;</verse>
    <verse num="4">one body and one Spirit (just as also you were called with one hope of your calling),</verse>
    <verse num="5">one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
    <verse num="6">one God and Father of all, who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> over all, and through all, and in all. </verse>
    <verse num="7">Now to each one of us was given this grace, according to the measure of Christ's gift.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Therefore it says, </verse>
    <verse num="9">Now "he ascended," what is <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, except that he also descended<note>Some secondary manuscripts add "first"</note> to the lower regions of the earth?</verse>
    <verse num="10">The one who descended himself is also the one who ascended above all the heavens, in order that he might fill all <transChange type="added">things</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="11">And he himself gave some <transChange type="added">as</transChange> apostles and some <transChange type="added">as</transChange> prophets and some <transChange type="added">as</transChange> evangelists and some <transChange type="added">as</transChange> pastors and teachers</verse>
    <verse num="12">for the equipping of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="13">until we all reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to a measure of the maturity of the fullness of Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="14">so that we may no longer be infants, tossed about by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of people, by craftiness with reference to the scheming of deceit.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow into him <transChange type="added">with reference to</transChange> all <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, who is the head, Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="16">from whom the whole body, joined together and held together by every supporting ligament, according to the working by measure of each single part, the growth of the body makes for the building up of itself in love. </verse>
    <verse num="17">This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, <transChange type="added">that</transChange> you no longer walk as the Gentiles walk: in the futility of their mind,</verse>
    <verse num="18">being darkened in understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance <transChange type="added">that</transChange> is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,</verse>
    <verse num="19">who, becoming callous, gave themselves over to licentiousness, for the pursuit of all uncleanness in greediness. </verse>
    <verse num="20">But you did not learn Christ in this way,</verse>
    <verse num="21">if indeed you have heard <transChange type="added">about</transChange> him, and you were taught by him (just as truth is in Jesus),</verse>
    <verse num="22"><transChange type="added">that</transChange> you take off, according to your former way of life, the old man, who is being destroyed according to deceitful desires,</verse>

    <verse num="24">and put on the new man (in accordance with God), who is created in righteousness and holiness from the truth. </verse>
    <verse num="25">Therefore, putting aside the lie, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor,<note>An allusion to Zech 8:16</note> because we are members of one another.</verse>

    <verse num="28">The one who steals must steal no longer, but instead must labor, working with his own hands <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> good, so that he may have <transChange type="added">something</transChange> to share with the one who has need.</verse>
    <verse num="29">{No rotten word must proceed}<note>Literally "Every rotten word must not proceed"</note> from your mouth, but only something good for the building up of the need, in order that it may give grace to those who hear,</verse>
    <verse num="30">and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
    <verse num="31">All bitterness, and rage, and wrath, and clamor, and abusive speech, must be removed from you, together with all wickedness.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Become<note>Some manuscripts have "But become"</note> kind toward one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as also God in Christ has forgiven you. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Therefore become imitators of God, as beloved children,</verse>
    <verse num="2">and live in love, just as also Christ loved us, and gave himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant smell.<note>Or "a fragrant offering"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or greediness, must not even be named among you (as is fitting for saints),</verse>
    <verse num="4">and obscenity, and foolish talk, or coarse jesting (which <transChange type="added">are</transChange> not proper), but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For this you know {for certain}<note>Literally "for this you know, knowing"</note>, that every sexually immoral <transChange type="added">person</transChange>, or unclean <transChange type="added">person</transChange>, or greedy <transChange type="added">person</transChange> (who is an idolater), does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience. </verse>
    <verse num="7">Therefore do not be sharers<note>Or "partners"</note> with them,</verse>
    <verse num="8">for you were formerly darkness, but now <transChange type="added">you are</transChange> light in the Lord. Live like children of light</verse>

    <verse num="10">trying to learn what is well-pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even expose <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For it is shameful even to speak <transChange type="added">about</transChange> the things being <transChange type="added">done</transChange> by them in secret,</verse>
    <verse num="13">but all <transChange type="added">things</transChange> exposed by the light are made visible,</verse>
    <verse num="14">for everything made visible is light. Therefore it says, </verse>
    <verse num="15">Therefore, consider carefully how you live, not as unwise but as wise,</verse>
    <verse num="16">making the most of the time because the days are evil. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Because of this do not become foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord <transChange type="added">is</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And do not be drunk with wine (in which is dissipation), but be filled by the Spirit,</verse>
    <verse num="19">speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and singing praise in your heart to the Lord,</verse>
    <verse num="20">giving thanks always for all <transChange type="added">things</transChange> in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father,</verse>

    <verse num="24">But as the church is subject to Christ, thus also wives <transChange type="added">should be subject</transChange><note>*The words "should be subject" are not in the Greek text, but are an understood repetition from the previous clause</note> to their husbands in everything. </verse>
    <verse num="25">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for her;</verse>

    <verse num="28">Thus also husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. The one who loves his own wife loves himself.</verse>
    <verse num="29">For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also Christ <transChange type="added">does</transChange> the church,</verse>
