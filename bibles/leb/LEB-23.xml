    <verse num="1">The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> Hezekiah, kings of Judah. </verse>
    <verse num="2">Hear, heavens, and listen, earth, for Yahweh has spoken: "I reared children and I brought <transChange type="added">them</transChange> up, but they rebelled against me.</verse>
    <verse num="3">An ox knows its owner and a donkey the manger of its master. Israel does not know; my people do not understand.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Ah, sinful nation, a people heavy <transChange type="added">with</transChange> iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly. They have forsaken Yahweh; they have despised the holy one of Israel. They are estranged <transChange type="added">and gone</transChange> backward.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Why do you want to be beaten again? You continue <transChange type="added">in</transChange> rebellion. <transChange type="added">The</transChange> whole of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> head <transChange type="added">is</transChange> sick, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> whole of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> heart <transChange type="added">is</transChange> faint.</verse>
    <verse num="6">From the sole of the foot and up to <transChange type="added">the</transChange> head there is no health in it; bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed, and they have not been bound up and not softened with the oil.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Your country <transChange type="added">is</transChange> desolate, your cities <transChange type="added">are</transChange> burned <transChange type="added">with</transChange> fire; <transChange type="added">As for</transChange> your land, aliens are devouring it in your presence, and <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> desolate, like devastation <transChange type="added">by</transChange> foreigners.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a city that is besieged.<note>Or "preserved"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">If Yahweh of hosts had not left us survivors,<note>Hebrew "survivor"</note> we would have been as few as Sodom, we would have become like Gomorrah.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Hear the word of Yahweh, rulers of Sodom! Listen <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the teaching of our God, people of Gomorrah!</verse>
    <verse num="11">What <transChange type="added">is the</transChange> abundance of your sacrifices to me? says Yahweh. I have had enough <transChange type="added">of</transChange> burnt offerings of rams and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> fat <transChange type="added">of</transChange> fattened animals and I do not delight in <transChange type="added">the</transChange> blood of bulls and ram-lambs and goats.</verse>
    <verse num="12">When you come to appear before me, who asked for this from your hand: you trampling my courts?</verse>
    <verse num="13">You must not {continue}<note>Literally "increase" or "add to"</note> to bring offerings<note>Hebrew "offering"</note> of futility, incense--it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> an abomination to me; new moon and Sabbath, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> calling of a convocation-- I cannot endure iniquity with <transChange type="added">solemn</transChange> assembly.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become to me like <transChange type="added">a</transChange> burden, I am not able to bear <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers,<note>Hebrew "prayer"</note> I <transChange type="added">will</transChange> not be listening. Your hands are full of blood.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Wash! Make yourselves clean! Remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes! Cease to do evil!</verse>
    <verse num="17">Learn to do good! Seek justice! Rescue <transChange type="added">the</transChange> oppressed! Defend <transChange type="added">the</transChange> orphan! Plead for <transChange type="added">the</transChange> widow!</verse>
    <verse num="18">"Come now, and let us argue," says Yahweh. "Even though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white like snow; even though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.</verse>
    <verse num="19">If you are willing and you are obedient, you shall eat the good of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="20">But if you refuse and you rebel, you shall be devoured <transChange type="added">by the</transChange> sword.</verse>
    <verse num="21">How has a faithful city become like a whore? Full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Your silver has become <transChange type="added">as</transChange> dross; Your wine <transChange type="added">is</transChange> diluted with waters.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Your princes <transChange type="added">are</transChange> rebels and companions of thieves. Every one loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not defend <transChange type="added">the</transChange> orphan and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> legal dispute of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> widow does not come before them.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Therefore, the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: "Ah, I will be relieved of my enemies, and I will avenge myself on my foes.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And I will turn my hand against you; I will purify your dross like lye, and I will remove all <transChange type="added">of</transChange> your tin.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And I will restore your judges, as at the first, and your counselors, as at the beginning. After this {you will be called}<note>Literally "it will be called for you"</note> the city of righteousness, faithful city.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Zion will be redeemed by justice, and those of her who repent, by righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="28">But <transChange type="added">the</transChange> destruction <transChange type="added">of</transChange> rebels and sinners <transChange type="added">shall be</transChange> together, and those who forsake Yahweh will perish.</verse>
    <verse num="29">For you<note>Literally "they," but a few manuscripts read "you," which fits the context better</note> will be ashamed of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> oaks <transChange type="added">in</transChange> which you delighted, and you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.</verse>
    <verse num="30">For you shall be like an oak withering its leaves, and like a garden where there is no water for her.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And the strong <transChange type="added">man</transChange> shall become like tinder, and his work like a spark. And both of them shall burn together, and there is not one to quench <transChange type="added">them</transChange>."</verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: </verse>
    <verse num="2">And it shall happen in the future of the days the mountain of the house<note>Or "temple"</note> of Yahweh <transChange type="added">shall</transChange> be established; it will be among the highest<note>Literally "head"</note> of the mountains, and it shall be raised from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> hills. All <transChange type="added">of</transChange> the nations shall travel to him;</verse>
    <verse num="3">many peoples shall come. And they shall say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, to the house<note>Or "temple"</note> of the God of Jacob, and may he teach us part of his ways, and let us walk in his paths." For instruction shall go out from Zion, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="4">He shall judge between the nations and he shall arbitrate for many peoples. They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. A nation shall not lift up a sword against a nation, and they shall not learn war again.</verse>
    <verse num="5">House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For you have forsaken your people, house of Jacob, because they are full<note>Possibly "of diviners" was part of the original text here</note> from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> east, and <transChange type="added">of</transChange> soothsayers like the Philistines, and {they make alliances}<note>Literally "they clap <transChange type="added">hands</transChange>"</note> with the offspring of foreigners.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And its land is filled <transChange type="added">with</transChange> silver and gold, and there is no end to its treasures; and its land is filled <transChange type="added">with</transChange> horses, and <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> no end to its chariots.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Its land is filled <transChange type="added">with</transChange> idols; they bow down to the work of their<note>Hebrew "his"</note> hands, to what they made <transChange type="added">with</transChange> their<note>Hebrew "his"</note> fingers.</verse>
    <verse num="9">So humanity is humbled; everyone is humbled, and you must not forgive them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Enter into the rock and hide yourself in the dust from the presence of the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The {haughty eyes}<note>Literally "eyes of the haughtiness"</note> of humanity will<note>The Hebrew is singular</note> be brought low, and the pride of everyone will be humbled, and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> a day for Yahweh of hosts against all of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> proud and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> lofty and against all that is lifted up and humble,<note>Or "it will be humbled"</note></verse>
    <verse num="13">and against all the lofty and lifted up cedars of Lebanon, and against all the large trees of Bashan,</verse>
    <verse num="14">and against all the high mountains, and against all the lofty hills,</verse>
    <verse num="15">and against every kind of high tower, and against every kind of fortified wall,</verse>
    <verse num="16">and against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the ships of desire.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the haughtiness of the people shall be humbled, and the pride of everyone shall be brought low, and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the idols shall pass away entirely,</verse>
    <verse num="19">and they will enter into <transChange type="added">the</transChange> caves of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> rocks and into <transChange type="added">the</transChange> holes of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> ground from the presence of the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty {when he rises}<note>Literally "in his rising"</note> to terrify the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="20">On that day humanity will throw away its idols of silver and its idols of gold, which they made for it to worship, to the rodents<note>Or "moles"</note> and to the bats--</verse>
    <verse num="21">to enter into the crevices of the rocks and into the clefts of the crags from the presence of the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty, {when he rises}<note>Literally "in his rising"</note> to terrify the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Turn away from humanity, who <transChange type="added">has</transChange> breath in its nostrils,<note>Hebrew "nostril"</note> for by<note>Or "in"</note> what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> it esteemed?</verse>

  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">For look, the Lord Yahweh of hosts <transChange type="added">is</transChange> removing {every source of support}<note>Literally "supplies and supplies"</note> from Jerusalem and from Judah: all of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> supplies of bread and all of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> supplies of water,</verse>
    <verse num="2">mighty warrior and man of war, judge and prophet, and diviner and elder,</verse>
    <verse num="3">captain of fifty and the honorable men of rank, and counselor and skillful magicians and skillful enchanter.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I will make boys their princes, and children shall rule over them.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the people will be oppressed {by each other}<note>Literally "man by man"</note> and a man by his neighbor. The boy will act arrogantly toward the elder, and the dishonorable toward the honorable.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Indeed, a man will seize his brother <transChange type="added">in</transChange> the house of his father: "{You have a cloak};<note>Literally "a cloak for you"</note> you shall be a leader for us, and this heap of ruins <transChange type="added">shall be</transChange> under your hand!"</verse>
    <verse num="7">He will lift up <transChange type="added">his voice</transChange> on that day, saying, "I will not be a healer; in my house there is no bread and there is no cloak. You shall not make me <transChange type="added">the</transChange> leader of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> people!"</verse>
    <verse num="8">For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen because their speech and their deeds <transChange type="added">are</transChange> against Yahweh, defying the eyes of his glory.</verse>
    <verse num="9">The look on their faces testifies against them and they declare their sin like Sodom; they do not hide <transChange type="added">it</transChange>. Woe to their soul! For they have dealt out evil to themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Tell <transChange type="added">the</transChange> innocent<note>Singular</note> that <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> good for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Woe to the wicked!<note>Singular</note> <transChange type="added">It is</transChange> bad! For what is done <transChange type="added">by</transChange> his hands will be done to him.</verse>
    <verse num="12">My people--children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. My people, your leaders are misleading <transChange type="added">you</transChange>, and they confuse the course of your paths.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Yahweh takes his stand to conduct a legal case and takes his stand to judge <transChange type="added">the</transChange> peoples.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Yahweh enters into judgment with the elders of his people and its princes. "And you! You have devoured the vineyard; the spoil of the poor <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in your houses!</verse>
    <verse num="15">{Why}<note>Literally "What to you"</note> do you crush my people and grind <transChange type="added">the</transChange> face of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> poor?"</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Yahweh said: "Because<note>There are two Hebrew words for "because" here</note> the daughters of Zion are haughty, and they walk <transChange type="added">with</transChange> outstretched neck, and they give flirting glances <transChange type="added">with their</transChange> eyes, {mincing along as they go},<note>Literally "they go walking and mincing along"</note> and {with their feet they rattle their bangles},<note>Literally "they tinkle with their feet"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">the Lord will make the heads<note>Hebrew "head"</note> of the daughters of Zion scabby, and Yahweh will lay their foreheads bare."</verse>
    <verse num="18">In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets and the headbands and the crescent necklaces,</verse>
    <verse num="19">the pendants and the bracelets and the veils,</verse>
    <verse num="20">the headdresses and the armlets and the sashes, and the {perfume boxes}<note>Literally "houses of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> breath"</note> and the amulets,</verse>
    <verse num="21">the signet rings and the nose rings,</verse>
    <verse num="22">the festal robes and the mantles, and the cloaks and the handbags,</verse>
    <verse num="23">and the mirrors and the linen garments, and the turbans and the wraps.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And this shall happen: There will be a stench instead of perfume, and a rope instead of a sash, and baldness instead of a well-set hairdo, and a clothing wrap of sackcloth instead of a rich robe, branding instead of beauty.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Your men shall fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And her<note>That is, Jerusalem's</note> gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall be banished; she shall sit upon the ground.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">And seven women shall grasp at one man on that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread, and we will wear our own clothing; only {let us be called by your name}!<note>Literally "let your name be called upon us"</note> Take away our disgrace!"</verse>
    <verse num="2">On that day the branch of Yahweh shall become beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land <transChange type="added">shall become the</transChange> pride and glory of the survivors<note>Hebrew "survivor"</note> of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And this shall happen: He who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone written for life in Jerusalem,</verse>
    <verse num="4">when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from her midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Yahweh will create over all of the site<note>Or "place"</note> of {Mount Zion}<note>Literally "the mountain of Zion"</note> and over her assembly a cloud by day and smoke and the brightness of flaming fire <transChange type="added">by</transChange> night. Indeed, over all <transChange type="added">the</transChange> glory <transChange type="added">there will be</transChange> a canopy,</verse>
    <verse num="6">and it will be a shelter for shade from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> heat by day, and a refuge and a hiding place from rainstorm and from rain.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Let me sing for my beloved a song of my love concerning his vineyard: {My beloved had a vineyard}<note>Literally "A vineyard was for my beloved"</note> on {a fertile hill}.<note>Literally "a horn of a son of olive oil." The Hebrew for horn, qeren, sounds like the Hebrew for vineyard, kerem</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">And he dug it and cleared it of stones, and he planted it <transChange type="added">with</transChange> choice vines,<note>Hebrew "vine"</note> and he built a watchtower in the middle of it, and he even hewed out a wine vat in it, and he waited for <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to yield grapes-- but it yielded wild grapes.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men<note>Hebrew "man"</note> of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.</verse>
    <verse num="4">What more <transChange type="added">was there</transChange> to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why did I hope for <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to yield grapes, and it yielded wild grapes?</verse>
    <verse num="5">And now let me tell you what I myself am about to do to my vineyard. </verse>
    <verse num="6">And I will make it a wasteland; it shall not be pruned and hoed, and it shall be overgrown <transChange type="added">with</transChange> briers<note>Hebrew "brier"</note> and thornbushes.<note>Hebrew "thornbush"</note> And concerning the clouds, I will command {them not to send}<note>Literally "from sending"</note> rain down upon it.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the house of Israel, and the man<note>Or "people"</note> of Judah <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the plantation of his delight. <transChange type="added">And</transChange> he waited for justice,<note>The Hebrew word, mishpat, sounds like mishpakh in the next line</note> but look! Bloodshed!<note>The Hebrew word, mishpakh, sounds like mishpat in the previous line</note> For righteousness,<note>The Hebrew word, tsedaqah, sounds like tsa`aqah in the next line</note> but look! A cry of distress!<note>The Hebrew word, tsa`aqah, sounds like tsedaqah in the previous line</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Ah! Those who {join}<note>Literally "touch"</note> house with house, they join field together with field until {there is no place}<note>Literally "an end of place"</note> and you are caused to dwell alone in the midst of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Yahweh of hosts <transChange type="added">said</transChange> in my ears: </verse>
    <verse num="10">For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,<note>A bath is a liquid measure</note> and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> seed of a homer will yield an ephah.<note>An ephah is a dry measure equal to one-tenth of a homer</note></verse>
    <verse num="11">Ah! Those who rise early in the morning, they pursue strong drink. Those who linger in the evening, wine inflames them.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And <transChange type="added">there</transChange> will be lyre and harp, tambourine and flute, and wine <transChange type="added">at</transChange> their feasts, but they do not look at the deeds<note>Hebrew "deed"</note> of Yahweh, and they do not see the work of his hands.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Therefore my people will go into exile without knowledge, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> their<note>Hebrew "its"</note> nobles<note>Hebrew "noble"</note> <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> men of hunger, and their<note>Hebrew "its"</note> multitude <transChange type="added">is</transChange> parched <transChange type="added">with</transChange> thirst.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat, and it has opened wide its mouth without limit, and her<note>That is, Jerusalem's</note> nobles<note>Hebrew "noble"</note> will go down, and her multitude, her tumult and those who revel in her.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And humankind is bowed down, and man is brought low, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> eyes of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> haughty are humiliated.</verse>
    <verse num="16">But Yahweh of hosts is exalted by justice, and the holy God shows himself holy by righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And then <transChange type="added">the</transChange> lambs will graze as <transChange type="added">in</transChange> their pasture, and {fatlings, kids<note>Following the Septuagint, which reads the Hebrew grym (resident aliens) as gdym (young goats/sheep)</note> will eat among the sites of ruins.}<note>Literally "and ruins, fatlings, resident aliens, will eat"</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">Ah! Those who drag iniquity along with the cords of falsehood and sin as with rope of the cart,</verse>
    <verse num="19">those who say, "Let him make haste; let him hurry his work so that we may see it and let it draw near and let the plan of the holy one of Israel come so that we may know <transChange type="added">it</transChange>!"</verse>
    <verse num="20">Ah! Those who call evil good and good evil, those who put darkness for light and light for darkness, those who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</verse>
    <verse num="21">Ah! <transChange type="added">Those who are</transChange> wise in their own eyes and have understanding {in their view}!<note>Literally "before their faces"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">Ah! Heroes at drinking wine, and men of capability at mixing strong drink!</verse>
    <verse num="23">Those who acquit the guilty because of a bribe and remove <transChange type="added">the</transChange> justice of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> innocent from him.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and dry grass sinks down <transChange type="added">in the</transChange> flame, so their root will become like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> stench, and their blossom will go up like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> dust. For they have rejected the instruction of Yahweh of hosts, and they have treated the word of the holy one of Israel with contempt.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Therefore {Yahweh's wrath was kindled}<note>Literally "the anger of Yahweh became hot"</note> against his people, and he stretched out his hand against them<note>Hebrew "it"</note> and struck them,<note>Hebrew "it"</note> and the mountains quaked, and their corpses<note>Hebrew "corpse"</note> were like refuse in <transChange type="added">the</transChange> middle of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> streets.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And he will raise a signal for a nation<note>The Hebrew is plural, but the following verses refer to the nation as singular</note> from afar, and he will whistle for it from the end of the earth. And look! It comes quickly, swiftly!</verse>
    <verse num="27">None <transChange type="added">is</transChange> weary, and none among him stumbles; none slumbers and none sleeps. And no loincloth on his waist is opened, and no thong of his sandals is drawn away.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Whose arrows are sharp, and all of his bows are bent. The hoofs of his horses are reckoned like flint, and his wheels like the storm wind.</verse>
    <verse num="29">His roaring <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like the lion, and he roars like young lions. And he growls and seizes his prey, and he carries <transChange type="added">it</transChange> off, and not one can rescue <transChange type="added">it</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And he will roar over him on that day like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> roaring of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sea, and <transChange type="added">if</transChange> one looks to the land, look!

  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">In the year of the death of Uzziah the king, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and raised throne, and the hem of his robe <transChange type="added">was</transChange> filling the temple.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Seraphs <transChange type="added">were</transChange> standing above him. {Each had six wings}:<note>Literally "six wings six wings for one"</note> with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. </verse>
    <verse num="3">And the one called to the other and said, </verse>
    <verse num="4">And the pivots of the thresholds shook from the sound of those who called, and the house<note>Or "temple"</note> was filled <transChange type="added">with</transChange> smoke. </verse>
    <verse num="5">And I said, "Woe to me!

    <verse num="6">Then one of the seraphs flew to me, and in his hand <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs. </verse>
    <verse num="7">And he touched my mouth, and he said, </verse>
    <verse num="8">Then I heard <transChange type="added">the</transChange> voice of the Lord saying, </verse>

    <verse num="11">Then I said, "Until when, Lord?" </verse>

  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">This happened in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah. Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went<note>The Hebrew is singular</note> up <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Jerusalem for warfare against it,<note>Literally "her"</note> but he was not able to fight against it.<note>Literally "her"</note></verse>
    <verse num="2">When it was reported to the house of David, saying "Aram stands by Ephraim," his heart and the heart of his people shook like the shaking of the trees of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> forest because of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> wind. </verse>
    <verse num="3">Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, "Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on <transChange type="added">the</transChange> highway of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> washer's field.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And you must say to him, 'Take heed and be quiet! You must not fear, and your heart must not be faint because of these two stumps of smoldering firebrands, {because of the fierce anger of}<note>Literally "because of the fierceness of the anger of"</note> Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Because Aram has plotted evil against you <transChange type="added">with</transChange> Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="6">"Let us go up against Judah and let us tear her apart, {and let us lay it open and so bring it unto ourselves},<note>Literally "and let us break through her to us"</note> and let us install the son of Tabeel <transChange type="added">as</transChange> king in her midst."</verse>
    <verse num="7">Thus says the Lord Yahweh, "It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For the head of Aram <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Damascus, and the head of Damascus <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Rezin, and in sixty-five years from now Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the head of Ephraim <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Samaria, and the head of Samaria <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the son of Remaliah. If you do not believe then you will not endure." '" </verse>
    <verse num="10">And Yahweh continued to speak to Ahaz, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="11">"Ask for a sign for yourself from Yahweh God; make <transChange type="added">it</transChange> deep <transChange type="added">as</transChange> Sheol or make <transChange type="added">it</transChange> high as above."</verse>
    <verse num="12">But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I will not put Yahweh to the test." </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then he said, "Hear, house of David! <transChange type="added">Is it</transChange> too little for you to make men weary, that you should also make my God weary?</verse>
    <verse num="14">Therefore the Lord himself will give you<note>The Hebrew is plural</note> a sign. Look! the virgin<note>Or "young woman"</note> <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with child and she is about to give birth <transChange type="added">to</transChange> a son, and she shall call his name 'God with us.'</verse>
    <verse num="15">He shall eat curds and honey until he knows to reject the evil and to choose the good.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For before the boy knows to reject the evil and to choose the good, {the land whose two kings you dread will be abandoned.}<note>Literally "the land which you dread will be abandoned because of the face of her two kings"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="17">"Yahweh will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your ancestor<note>Or "father"</note> days that have not come since <transChange type="added">the</transChange> day Ephraim departed from Judah: the king of Assyria."</verse>
    <verse num="18">And this shall happen: On that day, Yahweh will whistle for the fly that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> at the end of the stream of Egypt and the bee that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the land of Assyria.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And all of them will come and settle in the rivers of the cliffs and in the clefts of the rocks and on all of the thornbushes and watering places.</verse>
    <verse num="20">On that day, the Lord will shave the head and the hair of the feet with a razor of the one hired from beyond <transChange type="added">the</transChange> river--with the king of Assyria--and it will even take off the beard.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And this shall happen: on that day, a young man will keep a young cow of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> herd and two sheep alive.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And this shall happen: because of the abundance of milk production, he will eat curds, for every one that is left in the midst of the land will eat curds and honey.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And this shall happen on that day: Every place where there are a thousand vines<note>Hebrew "vine"</note> for a thousand silver <transChange type="added">pieces</transChange> will become briers,<note>Hebrew "brier"</note> and it will be thornbushes.<note>Hebrew "thornbush"</note></verse>
    <verse num="24">One will go there with arrows and bow, for all of the land will be briers<note>Hebrew "brier"</note> and thornbushes.<note>Hebrew "thornbush"</note></verse>
    <verse num="25">And <transChange type="added">as for</transChange> all of the hills that they hoed with the hoe, you will not go there, <transChange type="added">for</transChange> fear of briers<note>Hebrew "brier"</note> and thornbushes.<note>Hebrew "thornbush"</note> And it will become like pastureland <transChange type="added">for</transChange> cattle and overtrodden land <transChange type="added">for</transChange> sheep. </verse>

  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">Then Yahweh said to me, "Take yourself a large tablet and write on it with a common stylus pen: Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And I will require reliable witnesses as a witness for me: Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah."</verse>
    <verse num="3">And I approached the prophetess, and she conceived, and she gave birth to a son. And Yahweh said to me, "Call his name Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For before the boy knows to call 'my father' and 'my mother,' <transChange type="added">one</transChange> will carry away the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria in the presence of the king of Assyria." </verse>
    <verse num="5">And Yahweh continued to speak to me again, saying, </verse>
    <verse num="6">"Because this people has refused the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices <transChange type="added">over</transChange> Rezin and the son of Remaliah,</verse>
    <verse num="7">therefore look! The Lord <transChange type="added">is</transChange> bringing up the waters of the great and mighty river against them, the king of Assyria and all his glory. </verse>

    <verse num="10">{Make a plan},<note>Literally "Plan counsel"</note> but it will be frustrated! Speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us!</verse>
    <verse num="11">For Yahweh said this to me {while his hand weighed heavily on me},<note>Literally "with the strength of the hand"</note> and he {warned me not to walk}<note>Literally "instructed me from walking"</note> in the way of this people, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="12">"You must not call conspiracy everything that this people calls conspiracy, and you must not {share its fear},<note>Literally "fear its fear"</note> and you must not be in dread.</verse>
    <verse num="13">You shall regard Yahweh of hosts as holy, and he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your<note>The Hebrew is plural</note> fear, and he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your dread.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he will become like a sanctuary and a stumbling-stone, and like a stumbling-rock for the two houses of Israel, like a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>

    <verse num="16">Bind up <transChange type="added">the</transChange> testimony; seal <transChange type="added">the</transChange> teaching among my disciples.</verse>

    <verse num="18">Look! I and the children whom Yahweh has given to me <transChange type="added">are</transChange> like signs and portents in Israel from Yahweh of hosts, the one who dwells on the mountain of Zion.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Now if they tell you, "Consult the ghosts and the spirits, those who chirp and those who mutter. Should not a people consult its gods, the dead on behalf of the living,</verse>

    <verse num="21">And it<note>That is, the nation</note> will pass through it<note>That is, the land</note> distressed and hungry, and this shall happen: when it is hungry, it will be enraged, and it will curse its king and its gods,<note>Or "God"</note> and it will face upwar</verse>

    <verse num="1"><note>Isaiah 9:1-21 in the English Bible is 8:23-9:20 in the Hebrew Bible</note> {But there will be no gloom for those who were in distress}.<note>Literally "Indeed there is no gloom for the one to whom there was anxiety for her"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="2">The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; light has shined on those who lived in a land of darkness.</verse>
    <verse num="3">You have made the nation numerous; you have not<note>The written text (Kethib) is "not," but the reading tradition (Qere) is "for it"</note> made the joy great.

    <verse num="4">For you have shattered the yoke of its burden and the stick of its shoulder, the rod of its oppressor, on<note>Hebrew "like"; the Hebrew letters for "like" and "on" look alike</note> the day of Midian.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For every boot {that marches and shakes the earth}<note>Literally "marching with shaking," which might mean "marching <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with shaking"</note> and garment rolled in blood {will}<note>Literally "and it will"</note> be for burning--fire fuel.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For a child has been born for us; a son has been given to us. And the dominion will be on his shoulder, and his name is called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</verse>
    <verse num="7">{His dominion will grow continually, and to peace there will be no end}<note>Literally "There is no end to the increase of the dominion and to peace"</note> on<note>Or "for"</note> the throne of David and over<note>Or "for"</note> his kingdom, to establish it<note>That is, the kingdom</note> and sustain it with justice and righteousness now and forever. The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The Lord has sent out a word against Jacob, and it fell on Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And all of the people knew it, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria in pride and arrogance of heart, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="11">So Yahweh strengthened {the adversaries of Rezin}<note>Or "his adversaries" if a copyist added "of Rezin" in error</note> against him, and he provoked his enemies--</verse>
    <verse num="12">Aram from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> east and Philistines<note>Hebrew "Philistine"</note> from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> west-- and they devoured Israel with the whole mouth.

    <verse num="13">And the people did not turn to the one who struck it,<note>That is, the people</note> and they did not seek Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="14">So Yahweh cut off head and tail from Israel, palm branch and reed <transChange type="added">in</transChange> one day.</verse>

    <verse num="16">And the leaders of this people were misleading <transChange type="added">them</transChange>, and those who were led <transChange type="added">were</transChange> confused.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Therefore the Lord did not rejoice over its young men, and he did not have compassion on its orphans and widows, for everyone <transChange type="added">was</transChange> godless and an evildoer, and every mouth <transChange type="added">was</transChange> speaking folly. In all of this his anger did not turn away, and still his hand <transChange type="added">is</transChange> stretched out.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For wickedness burned like fire; it consumed brier and thorn. And it kindled the thickets of the forest, and they swirled upward <transChange type="added">in</transChange> a column of smoke.</verse>
    <verse num="19">The land was burned through the wrath of Yahweh of hosts, and the people became like fire fuel. {People had no compassion toward each other}.<note>Literally "A man does not have compassion toward his brother"</note></verse>
    <verse num="20">They devoured on <transChange type="added">the</transChange> right but <transChange type="added">still</transChange> were hungry and devoured on <transChange type="added">the</transChange> left but they were not satisfied. Each one devoured the flesh of his arm,</verse>

    <verse num="8">Thus says Yahweh: "Just as the new wine is found in the cluster, and they say 'You must not destroy it, for <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> a blessing in it,' so I will do for the sake of my servants {by}<note>Literally "to"</note> not destroying {everyone}.<note>Literally "all"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="9">And I will bring descendant s<note>Hebrew "descendant"</note> out from Jacob, and a {people}<note>Literally "man"</note> from Judah to take possession of my mountain, and my chosen ones shall inherit it, and my servants shall settle there.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Sharon shall become a pasture for<note>Literally "of"</note> flocks,<note>Hebrew "flock"</note> and the valley of Achor a resting place for<note>Or "of"</note> herds<note>Hebrew "herd"</note> for my people who have sought me.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But<note>Or "and"</note> you {who forsake}<note>Literally "forsaking"</note> Yahweh, forgetting {my holy mountain},<note>Literally "the mountain of my holiness"</note> who set a table for Fortune, and who {pour out}<note>Literally "fill"</note> a jug of mixed wine for Destiny,</verse>
    <verse num="12">and I will remit you to the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter, because I called, but<note>Or "and"</note> you did not answer; I spoke, but<note>Or "and"</note> you did not listen, but<note>Or "and"</note> you did the evil in my eyes, and you chose that in which I do not delight."</verse>
    <verse num="13">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: </verse>
    <verse num="14">Look! My servants shall shout {for joy},<note>Literally "from goodness of heart"</note> but<note>Or "and"</note> you, you shall cry out {for pain}<note>Literally "from pain of heart"</note> and howl {for sadness}.<note>Literally "from a breaking of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> spirit"</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">And you shall leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse, and the Lord Yahweh will kill you, and he will {give}<note>Literally "call"</note> his servants another name.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Whoever blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of trustworthiness, and the one who swears an oath in the land shall swear by the God of trustworthiness, because the former troubles are forgotten, and they are hidden from my eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For look! I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> about to create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered, and they shall not {come to mind}.<note>Literally "go up to heart"</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">But rejoice and shout in exultation forever and ever <transChange type="added">over</transChange> what I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> about to create! For look! I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> about to create Jerusalem <transChange type="added">as a source of</transChange> rejoicing, and her people <transChange type="added">as a source of</transChange> joy.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And I will shout in exultation over Jerusalem, and I will rejoice over my people, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sound of weeping shall no longer be heard in it, or<note>Or "and"</note> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sound of a cry for help.</verse>
    <verse num="20">There will no longer be a nursing infant {who lives only a few}<note>Literally "of"</note> days, or<note>Or "and"</note> an old man who does not fill his days, for the boy will die {a hundred years old},<note>Literally "a son of a hundred year"</note> and the one who {fails to reach}<note>Literally "misses"</note> {a hundred years}<note>Literally "a son of a hundred year"</note> will be {considered}<note>Literally "treated"</note> accursed.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And they shall build houses and inhabit <transChange type="added">them</transChange>, and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</verse>
    <verse num="22">They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat. For the days of my people <transChange type="added">shall be</transChange> like the days of <transChange type="added">a</transChange> tree, and my chosen ones shall enjoy the work of their hands.</verse>
    <verse num="23">They shall not labor for nothing, and they shall not give birth to horror, for they {shall be offspring blessed by}<note>Literally "the offspring of the blessing of"</note> Yahweh, and their descendants with them.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And this will happen: before they call, I myself will answer; <transChange type="added">while</transChange> still they <transChange type="added">are</transChange> speaking, I myself will hear.</verse>
    <verse num="25"><transChange type="added">The</transChange> wolf and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> lamb shall feed like one, and <transChange type="added">the</transChange> lion shall eat straw like the ox, but<note>Or "and"</note> dust <transChange type="added">shall be</transChange> <transChange type="added">the</transChange> serpent's food. They shall do no evil, and they shall not destroy on all {my holy mountain},"<note>Literally "the mountain of my holiness"</note> says Yahweh.</verse>

  <chapter num="66">
    <verse num="1">Thus says Yahweh: </verse>
    <verse num="2">And my hand has made all these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, and all these {came to be},"<note>Literally "were"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">The one who slaughters <transChange type="added">a</transChange> bull strikes a man; the one who slaughters <transChange type="added">a</transChange> lamb for sacrifice breaks the neck <transChange type="added">of</transChange> a dog. The one who offers an offering, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> blood of swine; the one who offers frankincense blesses an idol. Indeed, they themselves have chosen their ways, and their soul delights in their abhorrence.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Indeed, I myself I will choose their ill treatment, and I will bring them objects of their dread, because I called, and {no one answered};<note>Literally "there was no one who answers"</note> I spoke and they did not listen, but<note>Or "and"</note> they did the evil in my eyes, and they chose that in which I do not delight."</verse>
    <verse num="5">Hear the word of Yahweh, you who are frightened at his word: </verse>
    <verse num="6">A voice, an uproar from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> city! A voice from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> temple! The voice of Yahweh {paying back}<note>Literally "rewarding retribution to"</note> his enemies!</verse>
    <verse num="7">Before she was in labor she gave birth; before labor pains<note>Hebrew "pain"</note> came to her, she gave birth to a son.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Who has heard <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> like this? Who has seen <transChange type="added">anything</transChange> like these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>? Can a land be born in one day? Or can a nation be born in a moment?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Shall I myself I break open and not {deliver}?"<note>Literally "cause to bring forth"</note> says Yahweh, "or I who {delivers}<note>Literally "causes to bring forth"</note> lock up <transChange type="added">the womb</transChange>?" says your God.</verse>
    <verse num="10">"Rejoice with Jerusalem and shout in exultation with her, all those who love her! Rejoice with her <transChange type="added">in</transChange> joy, all those who mourn over her,</verse>

    <verse num="15">For look! Yahweh will come in fire, and his chariots like the storm wind, to {give back}<note>Literally "cause to turn around"</note> his anger in wrath, and his rebuke in flames of fire.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For Yahweh enters into judgment <transChange type="added">on</transChange> all flesh with fire and his sword, and {those slain by}<note>Literally "the slain of"</note> Yahweh shall be many.</verse>
