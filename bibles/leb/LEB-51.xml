    <verse num="1">For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on behalf of you, and those in Laodicea, and all those who have not seen my face {in person}<note>Literally "in the flesh"</note>,</verse>
    <verse num="2">so that their hearts may be encouraged, united in love and into all the wealth of the full assurance of insight into the knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="3">in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.</verse>
    <verse num="4">I say this in order that no one will deceive you with persuasive speech,</verse>
    <verse num="5">for even if I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. </verse>
    <verse num="6">Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, live in him,</verse>

    <verse num="8">Beware lest {anyone take you captive}<note>Literally "anyone be the one who takes captive you"</note> through philosophy and empty deceit, according to {human tradition}<note>Literally "the tradition of men"</note>, according to the elemental spirits of the world and not according to Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="9">because in him all the fullness of deity dwells bodily,</verse>
    <verse num="10">and you are filled in him, who is the head over every ruler and authority,</verse>
    <verse num="11">in whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made by hands, by the removal of the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="12">having been buried with him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with <transChange type="added">him</transChange> through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>

    <verse num="16">Therefore do not let anyone judge you with reference to eating or<note>Some manuscripts have "and"</note> drinking or participation in a feast or a new moon or a Sabbath,</verse>
    <verse num="17">which are a shadow of what is to come, but the reality <transChange type="added">is</transChange> Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Let no one condemn you, taking pleasure in humility and the worship of angels, going into detail <transChange type="added">about</transChange> <transChange type="added">the things</transChange> which he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,</verse>
    <verse num="19">and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by the ligaments and sinews, grows with the growth of God. </verse>
    <verse num="20">If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why do you submit <transChange type="added">to them</transChange> as <transChange type="added">if</transChange> living in the world?</verse>
    <verse num="21">"Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch,"</verse>
    <verse num="22">which <transChange type="added">things</transChange> are all <transChange type="added">meant</transChange> for destruction by consuming according to human commandments and teachings,</verse>
    <verse num="23">which <transChange type="added">things</transChange> {although they have}<note>Literally "having"</note>,<note>*Here the participle ("having") is understood as concessive</note> to be sure, an appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and humility and unsparing treatment of the body, {do not have any value}<note>Literally "are not with any value"</note> against the indulgence of the flesh. </verse>

  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Therefore, if you have been raised together with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Set your mind on the things above, not <transChange type="added">on</transChange> the things on earth.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
    <verse num="4">When Christ, <transChange type="added">who is</transChange> your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Therefore put to death {what is earthly in you}<note>Literally "the members on the earth"</note>: sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustful passion, evil desire, and greediness, which is idolatry,</verse>
    <verse num="6">because of which the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience,</verse>
    <verse num="7">in which also you once lived, when you used to live in them.<note>Or "among them" (the pronoun may refer either to people or to sins)</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">But now you also lay aside all <transChange type="added">these</transChange> things: anger, rage, wickedness, slander, abusive language from your mouth.</verse>

    <verse num="10">and have put on the new <transChange type="added">man</transChange> that is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one who created him,</verse>
    <verse num="11">where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, <transChange type="added">or</transChange> free, but Christ <transChange type="added">is</transChange> all, and in all. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Therefore, as <transChange type="added">the</transChange> chosen of God, holy and <transChange type="added">dearly</transChange> loved, put on affection, compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience,</verse>
    <verse num="13">putting up with one another and forgiving one another. If anyone should have a complaint against anyone, just as also the Lord forgave you, thus also you <transChange type="added">do the same</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And to all these <transChange type="added">things</transChange> <transChange type="added">add</transChange> love, which is <transChange type="added">the</transChange> bond of perfection.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the peace of Christ must rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and be thankful.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another with all wisdom, with psalms, hymns, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God,</verse>
    <verse num="17">and everything {whatever}<note>Literally "if anything that"</note> you do in word or in deed, giving thanks <transChange type="added">for</transChange> all <transChange type="added">things</transChange> in the name of the Lord Jesus to God the Father through him. </verse>

    <verse num="20">Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing in the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Fathers, do not provoke your children, so that they will not become discouraged.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Slaves, obey your {human}<note>Literally "according to the flesh"</note> masters in everything, not {while being watched}<note>Literally "with eye-service"</note>, as people pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Whatever you do, accomplish <transChange type="added">it</transChange> from the soul, as to the Lord, and not to people,</verse>
    <verse num="24"><transChange type="added">because you</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal</note> know that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. Serve<note>Or "You serve"; the same Greek verb form can be understood as either imperative ("serve") or indicative ("you serve"), so that commentators and Bible translations differ</note> the Lord Christ.</verse>
