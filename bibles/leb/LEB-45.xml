  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called <transChange type="added">to be</transChange> an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,</verse>
    <verse num="2">which he promised previously through his prophets in the holy scriptures,</verse>
    <verse num="3">concerning his Son, who was born {a descendant}<note>Literally "of the seed"</note> of David according to the flesh,</verse>
    <verse num="4">who was declared Son of God in power according to {the Holy Spirit}<note>Literally "the Spirit of holiness"</note> by the resurrection from the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord,</verse>
    <verse num="5">through whom we have received grace and apostleship for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles<note>Or "nations"; the same Greek word can be translated "nations" or "Gentiles" depending on the context</note> on behalf of his name,</verse>
    <verse num="6">among whom you also are <transChange type="added">the</transChange> called of Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="7">To all those in Rome who are loved by God, called <transChange type="added">to be</transChange> saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </verse>
    <verse num="8">First, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed in the whole world.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness, how constantly I make mention of you,</verse>
    <verse num="10">always asking in my prayers if somehow now at last I may succeed to come to you in the will of God.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For I desire to see you, in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, in order to strengthen you,</verse>
    <verse num="12">that is, to be encouraged together with you through {our mutual faith}<note>Literally "the in one another faith"</note>, both yours and mine.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I intended to come to you, and was prevented until now, in order that I might have some fruit among you also, just as also among the rest of the Gentiles.<note>Or "nations"; the same Greek word can be translated "nations" or "Gentiles" depending on the context</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Thus {I am eager}<note>Literally "the according to me eagerness"</note> to proclaim the gospel also to you who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in Rome. </verse>
    <verse num="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For the righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith, just as it is written, "But the one who is righteous by faith will live."<note>Or "But the one who is righteous will live by faith" (differing only in word order)</note> </verse>
    <verse num="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of people, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,</verse>
    <verse num="19">because what can be known about God is evident among<note>Or "in"; or "within"</note> them, for God made <transChange type="added">it</transChange> clear to them.</verse>
    <verse num="20">For from the creation of the world, his invisible <transChange type="added">attributes</transChange>, both his eternal power and deity, are discerned clearly, being understood in the things created, so that they are without excuse.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For <transChange type="added">although they</transChange> knew God, they did not honor <transChange type="added">him</transChange> as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their reasoning, and their senseless hearts were darkened.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
    <verse num="23">and exchanged the glory of the immortal God with the likeness of an image of mortal human beings and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles. </verse>
    <verse num="24">Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to immorality, <transChange type="added">that</transChange> their bodies would be dishonored among themselves,</verse>
    <verse num="25">who exchanged the truth of God with a lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed for eternity. Amen. </verse>
    <verse num="26">Because of this, God gave them over to degrading passions, for their females exchanged the natural relations for those contrary to nature,</verse>
    <verse num="27">and likewise also the males, abandoning the natural relations with the female, were inflamed in their desire toward one another, males with males committing the shameless deed, and receiving in themselves the penalty that was necessary for their error.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And just as they did not see fit {to recognize God}<note>Literally "to have God in recognition"</note>, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do the things <transChange type="added">that are</transChange> not proper,</verse>
    <verse num="29">being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greediness, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malevolence. <transChange type="added">They are</transChange> gossipers,</verse>
    <verse num="30">slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, contrivers of evil, disobedient to parents,</verse>
    <verse num="31">senseless, faithless, unfeeling, unmerciful,</verse>
    <verse num="32">who, <transChange type="added">although they</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as concessive</note> know the requirements of God, that those who do such things are worthy of death, not only do they do the same <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, but also they approve of those who do <transChange type="added">them</transChange>. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Therefore you are without excuse, O man, every one <transChange type="added">of you</transChange> who passes judgment. For in that which you pass judgment on someone else, you condemn yourself, for you who are passing judgment are doing the same <transChange type="added">things</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But do you think this, O man who passes judgment on those who do such things, and who does the same <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
    <verse num="4">Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?</verse>
    <verse num="5">But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</verse>
    <verse num="6">who will reward each one according to his works:</verse>
    <verse num="7">to those who, by perseverance in good work, seek glory and honor and immortality, eternal life,</verse>
    <verse num="8">but to those <transChange type="added">who act</transChange> from selfish ambition and who disobey the truth, but who obey unrighteousness, wrath and anger.</verse>
    <verse num="9"><transChange type="added">There will be</transChange> affliction and distress for every {human being}<note>Literally "soul of man"</note> who does evil, of the Jew first and of the Greek,</verse>
    <verse num="10">but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and to the Greek.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For <transChange type="added">there</transChange> is no partiality with God. </verse>
    <verse num="12">For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For it is not the hearers of the law <transChange type="added">who are</transChange> righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous.<note>Or "will be justified"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, <transChange type="added">although they</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as concessive</note> do not have the law, are a law to themselves,</verse>
    <verse num="15">who show the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts <transChange type="added">one</transChange> after another accusing or even defending them</verse>
    <verse num="16">on the day when God judges the secret things of people, according to my gospel, through<note>Or "by"</note> Christ Jesus. </verse>
    <verse num="17">But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God</verse>
    <verse num="18">and know his will and approve the things that are superior, <transChange type="added">because you</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are instructed") which is understood as causal</note> are instructed by the law,</verse>
    <verse num="19">and are confident <transChange type="added">that</transChange> you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those in darkness,</verse>
    <verse num="20">an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Therefore, the one who teaches someone else, do you not teach yourself? The one who preaches not to steal, do you steal?</verse>
    <verse num="22">The one who says not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The one who abhors idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
    <verse num="23">Who boast in the law, by the transgression of the law you dishonor God!<note>Or "do you dishonor God?" (a number of translators and interpreters take this phrase as a final rhetorical question; the present translation regards it as a final summary statement to be taken ironically)</note></verse>
    <verse num="24">For just as it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."<note>A quotation from Isa 52:5</note> </verse>
    <verse num="25">For circumcision is of value if you do the law, but if you should be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Therefore, if the uncircumcised person follows the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision?</verse>
    <verse num="27">And the uncircumcised person by nature who carries out the law will judge you who, <transChange type="added">though provided</transChange> with {the precise written code}<note>Literally "the letter"</note> and circumcision <transChange type="added">are</transChange> a transgressor of the law.</verse>
    <verse num="28">For the Jew is not {one outwardly}<note>Literally "in the open"</note>, nor <transChange type="added">is</transChange> circumcision {outwardly}<note>Literally "in the open"</note>, in the flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="29">But the Jew {is one inwardly}<note>Literally "in secret"</note>, and circumcision <transChange type="added">is</transChange> of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter, whose praise <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not from people but from God. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Therefore, what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the advantage of the Jew, or what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the use of circumcision?</verse>
    <verse num="2">Much in every way. For first, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
    <verse num="3">{What is the result}<note>Literally "for what"</note> if some refused to believe? Their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, <transChange type="added">will it</transChange>?</verse>
    <verse num="4">May it never be! But let God be true but every human being a liar, just as it is written, </verse>
    <verse num="5">But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God, who inflicts wrath, <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not unjust, <transChange type="added">is he</transChange>? (I am speaking according to a human perspective.)</verse>
    <verse num="6">May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?</verse>
    <verse num="7">But if by my lying, the truth of God abounded to his glory, why am I also still condemned as a sinner?</verse>
    <verse num="8">And <transChange type="added">why</transChange> not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say), "Let us do evil, in order that good may come <transChange type="added">of it</transChange>? Their<note>Literally "whose"</note> condemnation is just! </verse>
    <verse num="9">What then? Do we have an advantage? Not at all. For we have already charged both Jews and Greeks are all under sin,</verse>
    <verse num="10">just as it is written, </verse>
    <verse num="11"><transChange type="added">there</transChange> is no one who understands; <transChange type="added">there</transChange> is no one who seeks God.</verse>
    <verse num="12">All have turned aside together; they have become worthless; <transChange type="added">There</transChange> is no one who practices kindness; <transChange type="added">there</transChange> is not even one.<note>Verses 10-12 are a quotation from Ps 14:1-3</note></verse>
    <verse num="13">Their throat <transChange type="added">is</transChange> an opened grave; they deceive with their tongues; the venom of asps <transChange type="added">is</transChange> under their lips,<note>A quotation from Ps 5:9 and Ps 140:3</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.<note>A quotation from Ps 10:7</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">Their feet <transChange type="added">are</transChange> swift to shed blood;</verse>
    <verse num="16">destruction and distress <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in their paths,</verse>
    <verse num="17">and they have not known the way of peace.<note>Verses 15-17 are a quotation from Isa 59:7-8</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">The fear of God is not before their eyes."<note>A quotation from Ps 36:1</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law, in order that every mouth may be closed and the whole world may become accountable to God.</verse>
    <verse num="20">For by the works of the law {no person will be declared righteous}<note>Literally "all flesh will not be declared righteous"</note> before him, for through the law <transChange type="added">comes</transChange> knowledge of sin. </verse>
    <verse num="21">But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified about by the law and the prophets--</verse>
    <verse num="22">that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ<note>Or "through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ"</note> to all who believe. For <transChange type="added">there</transChange> is no distinction,</verse>
    <verse num="23">for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</verse>
    <verse num="24">being justified as a gift by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
    <verse num="25">whom God made publicly available as the mercy seat<note>Or "as the place of propitiation"</note> through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previously committed sins,</verse>
    <verse num="26">in the forbearance of God, for the demonstration of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just and the one who justifies the <transChange type="added">person</transChange> by faith<note>Or "by Jesus' faithfulness"</note> in Jesus. </verse>
    <verse num="27">Therefore, where <transChange type="added">is</transChange> boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law<note>Or "a principle"</note> of faith.</verse>
    <verse num="28">For we consider a person to be justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Or <transChange type="added">is God</transChange> the God of the Jews only? <transChange type="added">Is he</transChange> not also <transChange type="added">the God</transChange> of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles,</verse>
    <verse num="30">since God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> one, who will justify {those who are circumcised}<note>Literally "circumcision"</note> by faith and {those who are uncircumcised}<note>Literally "uncircumcision"</note> through faith.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Therefore, do we nullify the law through faith? May it never be! But we uphold the law. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">What then shall we say <transChange type="added">that</transChange> Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh, has found?</verse>
    <verse num="2">For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For what does the scripture say? "And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness."<note>A quotation from Gen 15:6</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">Now to the one who works, his pay is not credited according to grace, but according to his due.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But to the one who does not work, but who believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited for righteousness,</verse>
    <verse num="6">just as David also speaks about the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: </verse>
    <verse num="7">"Blessed <transChange type="added">are they</transChange> whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins are covered over.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Blessed <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the person against whom the Lord will never count sin."<note>A quotation from Ps 32:1-2</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">Therefore, <transChange type="added">is</transChange> this blessing for {those who are circumcised}<note>Literally "the circumcision"</note>, or also for {those who are uncircumcised}<note>Literally "the uncircumcision"</note>? For we say, "Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness."<note>A quotation from Gen 15:6</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">How then was it credited? <transChange type="added">While he</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">while</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as temporal</note> was {circumcised}<note>Literally "in circumcision"</note> or {uncircumcised}<note>Literally "in uncircumcision"</note>? Not {while circumcised}<note>Literally "in circumcision"</note> but {while uncircumcised}<note>Literally "in uncircumcision"</note>!</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he received the sign of circumcision <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a seal<note>Or "confirmation"</note> of the righteousness by faith which <transChange type="added">he had</transChange> {while uncircumcised}<note>Literally "in uncircumcision"</note>, so that he could be the father of all who believe {although they are uncircumcised}<note>Literally "through uncircumcision"</note>, so that righteousness could be credited to them,<note>Some manuscripts have "could be credited to them also"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">and the father {of those who are circumcised}<note>Literally "of the circumcision"</note> to those who are not only from the circumcision, but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham {which he had while uncircumcised}<note>Literally "of the in uncircumcision faith of our father Abraham"</note>. </verse>
    <verse num="13">For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants, <transChange type="added">that</transChange> he would be heir of the world, <transChange type="added">was</transChange> not through the law, but through the righteousness by faith.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For if those of the law <transChange type="added">are</transChange> heirs, faith is rendered void and the promise is nullified.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For the law produces wrath, but where <transChange type="added">there</transChange> is no law, neither <transChange type="added">is there</transChange> transgression.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Because of this, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> by faith, in order that <transChange type="added">it may be</transChange> according to grace, so that the promise may be secure to all the descendants, not only to those of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</verse>
    <verse num="17">(just as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations")<note>A quotation from Gen 17:5</note> before God, in whom he believed, the one who makes the dead alive and who calls the things that are not as <transChange type="added">though</transChange> they are,</verse>
    <verse num="18">who against hope believed in hope, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said, "so will your descendants be."<note>A quotation from Gen 15:5</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">And not being weak in faith, he considered his own body as good as dead, <note>Some manuscripts have "already as good as dead"</note> <transChange type="added">because he</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("was") which is understood as causal</note> was approximately a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he did not waver in unbelief at the promise of God, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God</verse>
    <verse num="21">and being fully convinced that what he had promised, he was also able to do.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Therefore<note>Some manuscripts have "Therefore, indeed,"</note> it was credited to him for righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="23">But it was not written for the sake of him alone that it was credited to him,</verse>
    <verse num="24">but also for the sake of us to whom it is going to be credited, to those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,</verse>
    <verse num="25">who was handed over on account of our trespasses, and was raised up in the interest of our justification.<note>Or "vindication"; or "acquittal"</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Therefore, <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have been declared righteous") which is understood as causal</note> have been declared righteous by faith, we have<note>Although a number of important manuscripts read the subjunctive mood here ("let us have"), almost all English versions prefer the indicative mood ("we have") which is supported by many other manuscripts</note> peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
    <verse num="2">through whom also we have <transChange type="added">obtained</transChange> access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And not only <transChange type="added">this</transChange>, but we also boast in our afflictions, <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal</note> know that affliction produces patient endurance,</verse>
    <verse num="4">and patient endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope,</verse>
    <verse num="5">and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us. </verse>
    <verse num="6">For <transChange type="added">while</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">while</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as temporal</note> we were still helpless, yet at the proper time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For only rarely will someone die on behalf of a righteous person (for on behalf of a good person possibly someone might even dare to die),</verse>
    <verse num="8">but God demonstrates his own love for us, <transChange type="added">in</transChange> that <transChange type="added">while</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">while</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as temporal</note> we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Therefore, by much more, <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have been declared righteous") which is understood as causal</note> have been declared righteous now by his blood, we will be saved through him from the wrath.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For if, <transChange type="added">while we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">while</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as temporal</note> were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, by much more, having been reconciled, we will be saved by his life.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And not only <transChange type="added">this</transChange>, but also <transChange type="added">we are</transChange> boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Because of this, just as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death spread to all people because all sinned.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one's account <transChange type="added">when there</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is") which is understood as temporal</note> is no law.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who is to come.</verse>
    <verse num="15">{But the gift is not like the trespass}<note>Literally "but not like the trespass so also the gift"</note>, for if by the trespass of the one, the many died, by much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, multiply to the many.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the gift <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not as through the one who sinned, for on the one hand, judgment from the one <transChange type="added">sin</transChange> <transChange type="added">led</transChange> to condemnation, but the gift, from many trespasses, <transChange type="added">led</transChange> to justification.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For if by the trespass of the one <transChange type="added">man</transChange>, death reigned through the one <transChange type="added">man</transChange>, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Consequently therefore, as through one trespass <transChange type="added">came</transChange> condemnation to all people, so also through one righteous deed <transChange type="added">came</transChange> justification of life to all people.</verse>
    <verse num="19">For just as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one, the many will be made righteous.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Now the law came in as a side issue, in order that the trespass could increase, but where sin increased, grace was present in greater abundance,</verse>
    <verse num="21">so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">What therefore shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, in order that grace may increase?</verse>
    <verse num="2">May it never be! How can we who died to sin still live in it?</verse>
    <verse num="3">Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse>
    <verse num="4">Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we may live {a new way of life}<note>Literally "in newness of life"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For if we have become identified with <transChange type="added">him</transChange> in the likeness of his death, certainly also we will be <transChange type="added">identified with him in the likeness</transChange><note>The elliptical phrase "identified with him in the likeness" has been supplied in the translation for clarity</note> of <transChange type="added">his</transChange> resurrection,</verse>
    <verse num="6">knowing this, that our old man was crucified together with <transChange type="added">him</transChange>, in order that the body of sin may be done away with, <transChange type="added">that</transChange> we may no longer be enslaved to sin.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For the one who has died has been freed from sin. </verse>
    <verse num="8">Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,</verse>

    <verse num="10">For that <transChange type="added">death</transChange> he died, he died to sin once and never again, but that <transChange type="added">life</transChange> he lives, he lives to God.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Or do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is master of a person for as long a time <transChange type="added">as</transChange> he lives?</verse>

    <verse num="3">Therefore as a result, if she belongs to another man <transChange type="added">while</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">while</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("is living") which is understood as temporal</note> her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress.

    <verse num="4">So then, my brothers, you also were brought to death with respect to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For when we were in the flesh, sinful desires were working through the law in our members, to bear fruit for death.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But now we have been released from the law, <transChange type="added">because we</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have died") which is understood as causal</note> have died <transChange type="added">to that</transChange> by which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter <transChange type="added">of the law</transChange>. </verse>
    <verse num="7">What then shall we say? <transChange type="added">Is</transChange> the law sin? May it never be!

    <verse num="8">But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all <transChange type="added">kinds of</transChange> covetousness. For apart from the law, sin <transChange type="added">is</transChange> dead.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And I was alive once, apart from the law, but <transChange type="added">when</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal</note> the commandment came, sin sprang to life</verse>

    <verse num="11">For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed <transChange type="added">me</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So then, the law <transChange type="added">is</transChange> holy, and the commandment <transChange type="added">is</transChange> holy and righteous and good. </verse>
    <verse num="13">Therefore, <transChange type="added">did that which is</transChange> good become death to me? May it never be!

    <verse num="14">For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, {sold into slavery to sin}<note>Literally "sold under sin"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For what I am doing I do not understand, because what I want <transChange type="added">to do</transChange>, this I do not practice, but what I hate, this I do.</verse>

    <verse num="21">Consequently, I find the principle with me, the one who wants to do good, that evil is present with me.<note>Or "in me"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my inner person,</verse>

    <verse num="5">For those who are <transChange type="added">living</transChange> according to the flesh are intent on the things of the flesh, but those <transChange type="added">who are living</transChange> according to the Spirit <transChange type="added">are intent on</transChange> the things of the Spirit.</verse>

    <verse num="8">and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God. </verse>

    <verse num="12">So then, brothers, we are obligated not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</verse>

    <verse num="15">For you have not received a spirit of slavery <transChange type="added">leading</transChange> to fear again, but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, "Abba!<note>"Abba" means "father" in Aramaic</note> Father!"</verse>
    <verse num="16">The Spirit himself confirms to our spirit that we are children of God,</verse>

    <verse num="31">What then shall we say about these <transChange type="added">things</transChange>? If God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for us, who <transChange type="added">can be</transChange> against us?</verse>

    <verse num="2">God has not rejected his people, whom he foreknew! Or do you not know, in <transChange type="added">the passage about</transChange><note>*The words "the passage about" are not in the Greek text, but are supplied for clarity</note> Elijah, what the scripture says--how he appeals to God against Israel?</verse>
    <verse num="3">"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life!"<note>A quotation from 1 Kgs 19:10, 14</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">But what does the divine response say to him? "I have left for myself seven thousand people<note>Or perhaps "males," referring to men only</note> who have not bent the knee to Baal."<note>A quotation from 1 Kgs 19:18</note></verse>
    <verse num="5">So in this way also at the present time, there is a remnant {selected by grace}<note>Literally "according to selection of grace"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But if by grace, <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> no longer by works, for otherwise grace would no longer be grace. </verse>
    <verse num="7">What then? What Israel was searching for, this it did not obtain. But the elect obtained <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, and the rest were hardened,</verse>
    <verse num="8">just as it is written, </verse>
    <verse num="9">And David says, </verse>
    <verse num="10">let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see, and cause their backs to bend {continually}<note>Literally "throughout everything"</note>."<note>A quotation from Ps 69:22-23</note></verse>
    <verse num="11">I say then, they did not stumble so that they fell, <transChange type="added">did they</transChange>?<note>*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here</note> May it never be! But by their trespass, salvation <transChange type="added">has come</transChange> to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them <transChange type="added">to jealousy</transChange>.<note>*The words "to jealousy" are not in the Greek text, but are supplied for clarity</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">And if their trespass <transChange type="added">means</transChange> riches for the world and their loss <transChange type="added">means</transChange> riches for the Gentiles, how much more <transChange type="added">will</transChange> their fullness <transChange type="added">mean</transChange>? </verse>
    <verse num="13">Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Therefore, inasmuch as I am apostle to the Gentiles, I promote my ministry,</verse>
    <verse num="14">if somehow I may provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For if their rejection <transChange type="added">means</transChange> the reconciliation of the world, what <transChange type="added">will</transChange> their acceptance <transChange type="added">mean</transChange> except life from the dead?</verse>
    <verse num="16">Now if the first fruits <transChange type="added">are</transChange> holy, <transChange type="added">so</transChange> also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the <transChange type="added">whole</transChange> batch of dough, and if the root <transChange type="added">is</transChange> holy, <transChange type="added">so</transChange> also <transChange type="added">are</transChange> the branches. </verse>
    <verse num="17">Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, <transChange type="added">although you</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">although</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("were") which is understood as concessive</note> were a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the root of the olive tree's richness,</verse>
    <verse num="18">do not boast against the branches. But if you boast against <transChange type="added">them</transChange>, you do not support the root, but the root <transChange type="added">supports</transChange> you.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then you will say, "Branches were broken off in order that I could be grafted in."</verse>
    <verse num="20">Well said! They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand firm because of faith. Do not think arrogant <transChange type="added">thoughts</transChange>, but be afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For if God did not spare the {natural}<note>Literally "according to nature"</note> branches, neither will he spare you.<note>Some manuscripts have "perhaps he will not spare you either"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity upon those who have fallen, but upon you the kindness of God--if you continue in his kindness, for otherwise you also will be cut off.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And those also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
    <verse num="24">For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are {natural branches}<note>Literally "by nature"</note> be grafted into their own olive tree? </verse>
    <verse num="25">For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you will not be wise {in your own sight},<note>Literally "in yourselves"</note> that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in,</verse>
    <verse num="26">and so all Israel will be saved, just as it is written, </verse>
    <verse num="27">And this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the covenant from me with them<note>A quotation from Isa 59:20-21</note> when I take away their sins."<note>A quotation from Isa 27:9; Jer 31:33-34</note></verse>
    <verse num="28">With respect to the gospel, <transChange type="added">they are</transChange> enemies for your sake, but with respect to election, <transChange type="added">they are</transChange> dearly loved for the sake of the fathers.</verse>
    <verse num="29">For the gifts and the calling of God <transChange type="added">are</transChange> irrevocable.</verse>
    <verse num="30">For just as you formerly were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of the disobedience of these,</verse>
    <verse num="31">so also these have now been disobedient for your mercy, in order that they also may now be shown mercy.</verse>
    <verse num="32">For God confined them all in disobedience, in order that he could have mercy on them all. </verse>
    <verse num="33">Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable <transChange type="added">are</transChange> his judgments and <transChange type="added">how</transChange> incomprehensible <transChange type="added">are</transChange> his ways!</verse>
    <verse num="34">"For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?<note>A quotation from Isa 40:13</note></verse>
    <verse num="35">Or who has given in advance to him, and it will be paid back to him?"<note>A quotation from Job 41:11</note></verse>
    <verse num="36">For from him and through him and to him <transChange type="added">are</transChange> all <transChange type="added">things</transChange>. To him <transChange type="added">be</transChange> glory for eternity! Amen.</verse>

  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">Therefore I exhort you, brothers, through the mercies of God, to present your bodies <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a living sacrifice, holy <transChange type="added">and</transChange> pleasing to God, <transChange type="added">which is</transChange> your reasonable service.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, so that you may approve what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the good and well-pleasing and perfect will of God. </verse>
    <verse num="3">For by the grace given to me I say to everyone who is among you not to think more highly of yourself than what one ought to think, but to think {sensibly}<note>Literally "so as to be sensible"</note>, as God has apportioned a measure of faith to each one.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For just as in one body we have many members, but all the members do not have the same function,</verse>
    <verse num="5">in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ, and {individually}<note>Literally "with respect to one"</note> members of one another,</verse>
    <verse num="6">but having different gifts according to the grace given to us: if <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> prophecy, according to the proportion of <transChange type="added">his</transChange> faith;</verse>
    <verse num="7">if <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> service, by service; if <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> one who teaches, by teaching;</verse>
    <verse num="8">if <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> one who exhorts, by exhortation; one who gives, with sincerity; one who leads, with diligence; one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. </verse>
    <verse num="9">Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> evil; be attached to what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good,</verse>
    <verse num="10">being devoted to one another in brotherly love, esteeming one another <transChange type="added">more highly</transChange> in honor,</verse>
    <verse num="11">not lagging in diligence, being enthusiastic in spirit, serving the Lord,</verse>
    <verse num="12">rejoicing in hope, enduring in affliction, being devoted to prayer,</verse>
    <verse num="13">contributing to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality. </verse>
    <verse num="14">Bless those who persecute,<note>Some manuscripts have "who persecute you"</note> bless and do not curse <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Think the same <transChange type="added">thing</transChange> toward one another; {do not think arrogantly}<note>Literally "think not the arrogant"</note>, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise {in your own sight}<note>Literally "in the sight of yourselves"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Pay back no one evil for evil. Take thought for <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> good in the sight of all people.</verse>
    <verse num="18">If <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> possible on your <transChange type="added">part</transChange>, be at peace with all people.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Do not take revenge yourselves, dear friends, but give place to <transChange type="added">God's</transChange> wrath, for it is written, "Vengeance <transChange type="added">is</transChange> mine, I will repay,"<note>A quotation from Deut 32:35</note> says the Lord.</verse>
    <verse num="20">But "if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him <transChange type="added">something</transChange> to drink; for <transChange type="added">by</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">by</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("doing") which is understood as means</note> doing this, you will heap up coals of fire upon his head."<note>A quotation from Prov 25:21-22</note></verse>
    <verse num="21">Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for <transChange type="added">there</transChange> is no authority except by God, and those that exist are put in place by God.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So then, the one who resists authority resists the ordinance <transChange type="added">which is</transChange> from God, and those who resist will receive condemnation on themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For rulers are not a <transChange type="added">cause of</transChange> terror for a good deed, but for bad <transChange type="added">conduct</transChange>. So do you want not to be afraid of authority? Do what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good, and you will have praise from it,</verse>
    <verse num="4">for it is God's servant to you for what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good. But if you do what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> bad, be afraid, because it does not bear the sword to no purpose. For it is God's servant, the one who avenges for punishment on the one who does <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> bad.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Therefore <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For because of this you also pay taxes, for <transChange type="added">the authorities</transChange><note>Literally "they"</note> are servants of God, busily engaged in this very <transChange type="added">thing</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Pay to everyone <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> owed: <transChange type="added">pay</transChange> taxes to whom taxes <transChange type="added">are due</transChange>; <transChange type="added">pay</transChange> customs duties to whom customs duties <transChange type="added">are due</transChange>; <transChange type="added">pay</transChange> respect to whom respect <transChange type="added">is due</transChange>; <transChange type="added">pay</transChange> honor to whom honor <transChange type="added">is due</transChange>.<note>Due to the very compressed style in this verse, many words must be supplied to make sense in English</note> </verse>
    <verse num="8">Owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another, for the one who loves someone else has fulfilled the law.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For the <transChange type="added">commandments</transChange>, "You shall not commit adultery, you shall not commit murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,"<note>A quotation from Exod 20:13-15, 17; Deut 5:17-19, 21</note> and if <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> any other commandment, are summed up in this statement: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."<note>A quotation from Lev 19:18</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">Love does not commit evil against a neighbor. Therefore love <transChange type="added">is the</transChange> fulfillment of the law. </verse>
    <verse num="11">And <transChange type="added">do</transChange> this <transChange type="added">because you</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">because</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal</note> know the time, that <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> already the hour for you to wake up from sleep. For our salvation <transChange type="added">is</transChange> nearer now than when we believed.</verse>
    <verse num="12">The night is far gone, and the day has drawn near. Therefore let us throw off<note>Some manuscripts have "let us lay aside"</note> the deeds of darkness and put on the weapons of light.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Let us live decently, as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="14">
    <verse num="1">Now receive the one who is weak in faith, <transChange type="added">but</transChange> not for quarrels about opinions.</verse>
    <verse num="2">One believes <transChange type="added">he may</transChange> eat all <transChange type="added">things</transChange>, but the one who is weak eats <transChange type="added">only</transChange> vegetables.</verse>
    <verse num="3">The one who eats must not despise the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat must not judge the one who eats, because God has accepted him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Who are you, who passes judgment on the domestic slave belonging to someone else? To his own master he stands or falls, and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. </verse>
    <verse num="5">One person<note>Some manuscripts have "For one person"</note> prefers <transChange type="added">one</transChange> day over <transChange type="added">another</transChange> day, and another person regards every day <transChange type="added">alike</transChange>. Each one must be fully convinced in his own mind.</verse>
    <verse num="6">The one who is intent on the day is intent on <transChange type="added">it</transChange> for the Lord, and the one who eats eats for the Lord, because he is thankful to God, and the one who does not eat does not eat for the Lord, and he is thankful to God.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore whether we live <transChange type="added">or</transChange> whether we die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For Christ died and became alive again for this <transChange type="added">reason</transChange>, in order that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living. </verse>
    <verse num="10">But why do you judge your brother? Or also, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For it is written, </verse>
    <verse num="12">So<note>Some manuscripts have "So then,"</note> each one of us will give an account concerning himself.<note>Some manuscripts have "an account concerning himself to God"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="13">Therefore, let us no longer pass judgment on one another, but rather decide this: not to place a cause for stumbling or a temptation before a brother.</verse>
    <verse num="14">I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing <transChange type="added">is</transChange> unclean of itself, except to the one who considers something to be unclean; to that person <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> unclean.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For if because of food, your brother is grieved, you are no longer living according to love. Do not destroy by your food that person for whom Christ died.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Therefore do not let your good be slandered.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For the one who serves Christ in this <transChange type="added">way</transChange> <transChange type="added">is</transChange> well-pleasing to God and approved by people. </verse>
    <verse num="19">So then, let us pursue {what promotes peace}<note>Literally "the things of peace"</note> and {what edifies one another}<note>Literally "the things of edification toward one another"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Do not destroy the work of God on account of food. All <transChange type="added">things</transChange> <transChange type="added">are</transChange> clean, but <transChange type="added">it is</transChange> wrong for the person {who eats and stumbles in the process}<note>Literally "who eats with stumbling"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="21"><transChange type="added">It is</transChange> good not to eat meat or to drink wine or <transChange type="added">to do anything</transChange> by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is weakened.<note>Some manuscripts omit "or is offended or is weakened"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">The faith that you have, have with respect to yourself before God. Blessed <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the one who does not pass judgment on himself by what he approves.</verse>
    <verse num="23">But the one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not <transChange type="added">do so</transChange> from faith, and everything that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not from faith is sin. </verse>

  <chapter num="15">
    <verse num="1">But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Let each one of us please his neighbor for his good, for the purpose of edification.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For even Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written, "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me."<note>A quotation from Ps 69:9</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">For whatever was written beforehand was written for our instruction, in order that through patient endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now may the God of patient endurance and of encouragement grant you {to be in agreement}<note>Literally "to think the same"</note> with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus,</verse>
    <verse num="6">so that with one mind you may glorify with one mouth the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Therefore accept one another, just as Christ also has accepted you, to the glory of God. </verse>
    <verse num="8">For I say, Christ has become a servant of the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises to the fathers,</verse>

    <verse num="20">And so, having as my ambition to proclaim the gospel where Christ has not been named, in order that I will not build on the foundation belonging to someone else,</verse>
