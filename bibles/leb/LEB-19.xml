    <verse num="48">He also handed their cattle over to the hail and their livestock to the lightning bolts.</verse>
    <verse num="49">He sent against them his fierce anger, rage and indignation and trouble, a band of {destroying}<note>Literally "evil"</note> angels.</verse>
    <verse num="50">He cleared a path for his anger. He did not spare them<note>Hebrew "their soul"</note> from death but handed their life over to the plague.</verse>

    <verse num="59">God heard and he was very angry and rejected Israel utterly.</verse>
    <verse num="60">So he abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, <transChange type="added">the</transChange> tent he had placed among humankind.</verse>

    <verse num="62">He also handed his people over to the sword, and he was very angry with his inheritance.</verse>
    <verse num="63">Fire devoured his young men, and his young women<note>Or "virgins"</note> were not praised.</verse>
    <verse num="64">His priests fell by the sword, and his widows did not weep.</verse>
    <verse num="65">Then the Lord awoke like <transChange type="added">one who had been</transChange> asleep, <transChange type="added">awoke</transChange> like a warrior who had been drunk with wine.<note>Or "like a warrior shouting because of wine"</note></verse>
    <verse num="66">And he beat back his enemies; he gave them over to perpetual scorn.</verse>
    <verse num="67">And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not chose the tribe of Ephraim,</verse>
    <verse num="68">but chose the tribe of Judah, {Mount Zion}<note>Literally "the mountain of Zion"</note> that he loved.</verse>
    <verse num="69">And he built his sanctuary like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> heights, like <transChange type="added">the</transChange> earth that he established forever.</verse>
    <verse num="70">And he chose David his servant and took him from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> sheepfolds.</verse>
    <verse num="71">He brought him from following nursing ewes to shepherd Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.</verse>

    <verse num="8">Yet he saved them for the sake of his name, to make known his might.</verse>
    <verse num="9">So he rebuked {the Red Sea},<note>Literally "sea of reed"</note> and it dried up, and he led them through the deep as <transChange type="added">through</transChange> a desert.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Thus he saved them from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> hater and redeemed them from <transChange type="added">the</transChange> hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> enemy.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.</verse>
    <verse num="13">They quickly forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they {craved intensely}<note>Literally "craved a craving"</note> in the wilderness, and tested God in <transChange type="added">the</transChange> desert.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So he gave to them their request, but he sent leanness into their souls.<note>Hebrew "soul" or "inner self"</note></verse>
    <verse num="16">And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, <transChange type="added">and</transChange> of Aaron, the holy one of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="17"><transChange type="added">The</transChange> earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and it covered over the gang of Abiram.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Also fire burned in their assembly; <transChange type="added">the</transChange> flame devoured <transChange type="added">the</transChange> wicked.</verse>
    <verse num="19">They made a calf at Horeb and bowed down to a cast image.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And <transChange type="added">so</transChange> they exchanged their glory for an image of an ox that eats grass.</verse>
    <verse num="21">They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,</verse>

    <verse num="23">So he said he would exterminate them, had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to reverse his wrath from destroying <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then they refused the desirable land; they did not believe his word,</verse>
    <verse num="25">but grumbled in their tents. They did not obey the voice of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="26">So {he made an oath}<note>Literally "he lifted his hand," an act accompanying an oath</note> against them, to make them drop in the wilderness,</verse>
    <verse num="27">and to disperse<note>Or "let drop"</note> their {descendants}<note>Literally "seed"</note> among the nations and to scatter them among the lands.</verse>
    <verse num="28">They also attached themselves to Baal of Peor, and they ate sacrifices offered to <transChange type="added">the</transChange> dead.<note>Hebrew "sacrifices of dead"</note></verse>
    <verse num="29">Thus they provoked to anger by their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> the plague was stopped,</verse>
    <verse num="31">and it was reckoned to him as righteousness {throughout all generations}.<note>Literally "for a generation and a generation"</note></verse>
    <verse num="32">They also angered <transChange type="added">God</transChange> at the waters of Meribah, and it went badly for Moses on account of them,</verse>
    <verse num="33">because they rebelled against his Spirit,<note>A slightly different verbal form yields "they embittered his spirit"</note> and he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips.</verse>
    <verse num="34">They did not exterminate the peoples, as Yahweh had commanded them, <note>Hebrew "said to them"</note></verse>
    <verse num="35">but they mingled with the nations and learned their works,</verse>
    <verse num="36">and served their idols, which became<note>Hebrew "and they became"</note> a snare to them.</verse>
    <verse num="37">They even sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons,</verse>
    <verse num="38">and they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> the land was defiled with the blood.<note>Hebrew "bloods," that is, bloodshed</note></verse>
    <verse num="39">And they became unclean by their works, and were unfaithful in their deeds.</verse>
    <verse num="40">So Yahweh's anger burned against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.</verse>
    <verse num="41">Then he gave them into <transChange type="added">the</transChange> hand of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.</verse>
    <verse num="42">And their enemies oppressed them, and they were subdued under their hand.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Many times he delivered them, but they rebelled in their counsel, and were brought low by their iniquity.</verse>
    <verse num="44">Yet he looked upon their distress when he heard their cry.</verse>
    <verse num="45">And he remembered his covenant with them, and relented based on the abundance of his loyal love.</verse>
    <verse num="46">And he {let them find compassion}<note>Literally "gave them to <transChange type="added">have</transChange> mercies"</note> before all their captors.</verse>
    <verse num="47">Save us, O Yahweh our God, and gather us from the nations, so that <transChange type="added">we may</transChange> give thanks to your holy name <transChange type="added">and</transChange> boast in your praise.</verse>
