    <verse num="1">The words of the Teacher,<note>Hebrew "Qohelet"</note> the son of David, king in Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse num="2">"Vanity of vanities!" says the Teacher,<note>Hebrew "Qohelet"</note> "Vanity of vanities! All <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity!"</verse>
    <verse num="3">What does a person gain in all his toil with which he toils under the sun?</verse>
    <verse num="4">A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth stands forever.</verse>
    <verse num="5">The sun rises, and the sun goes down; to its place it hurries,<note>The MT reads "<transChange type="added">it</transChange> gasps <transChange type="added">for breath</transChange>," which is supported by LXX "to draw <transChange type="added">breath</transChange>"; the BHS editors suggest "<transChange type="added">it</transChange> returns again"</note> and there it rises again.</verse>
    <verse num="6">The wind goes to the south and goes around to the north; around and around it goes, and on its circuit the wind returns.</verse>
    <verse num="7">All the streams flow to the sea, but the sea is never full; to the place where the streams flow, there they continue to flow.</verse>
    <verse num="8">All things toil continuously;<note>Or "are wearisome"</note> no one can ever finish describing this.<note>The MT reads "no one is able to speak." The BHS editors suggest "no one can finish speaking." On the basis of internal evidence, the latter is adopted in the translation, since it makes better sense in the light of the immediate context</note> The eye is never<note>Or "not"</note> satisfied with seeing, and the ear is never<note>Or "not"</note> filled with hearing.</verse>
    <verse num="9">What has been--it is what will be; what has been done--it is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun.</verse>
    <verse num="10">There is a thing <transChange type="added">of</transChange> which it is said, "Look at this! This is new!" <transChange type="added">But</transChange> it already existed in ages past before us.</verse>
    <verse num="11">There is neither remembrance of former generations, nor will there be remembrance of future generations.</verse>
    <verse num="12">I, the Teacher,<note>Hebrew "Qohelet"</note> <transChange type="added">was</transChange> king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I applied my mind to seek and to search by wisdom all that is done under the heavens.<note>MT reads "under the heavens," which is supported by LXX; however, several versions (Syriac Peshitta, Aramaic Targum, Latin Vulgate) as well as the Cairo Geniza manuscript read, "under the sun," cf. 1:3, 9, etc.</note> It <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a grievous task God has given to {humans}.<note>Literally "the sons of the man"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">I saw all the works that are done under the sun. Look! Everything <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity and chasing wind. </verse>
    <verse num="15">What is twisted cannot be straightened,<note>The MT reads the active "to be straight"; however, the BHS editors suggest the passive "to be straightened," which is supported by LXX, which reflects a passive form</note> and what is lacking cannot be counted.<note>The MT reads "to be numbered"; however, the BHS editors suggest "to be supplied," comparing 1:15b with similar wording in the Babylonian Talmud: "May the Almighty replenish your loss" (b. Berachot 16b)</note></verse>
    <verse num="16">{I said to myself},<note>Literally "I myself said to my heart"</note> "Look! I have become great and have increased <transChange type="added">in</transChange> wisdom more than anyone who {has preceded}<note>Literally "before me"</note> me over Jerusalem. {I have acquired a great deal of wisdom and knowledge}."<note>Literally "And my mind has seen much wisdom and knowledge"</note></verse>
    <verse num="17">So {I dedicated myself}<note>Literally "So I gave my heart"</note> to learn about wisdom and <transChange type="added">to</transChange> learn about delusion and folly. However, I discovered<note>Or "I knew"</note> that this also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> chasing wind. </verse>
    <verse num="18">For in much wisdom <transChange type="added">is</transChange> much frustration,<note>Or "vexation"</note> and whoever increases knowledge increases sorrow.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">I said {to myself},<note>Literally "to my heart"</note> "Come! I will test<note>The MT reads "I will test you," but the BHS editors propose "I will test ..." Whether or not one adopts MT, Qohelet is speaking to himself</note> pleasure {to see whether it is worthwhile}."<note>Literally "and look at goodness"; this idiom refers to the enjoyment of life</note> But look, "This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity!"</verse>
    <verse num="2">I said of laughter, "<transChange type="added">It is</transChange> folly!" and of pleasure, "{What does it accomplish?}"<note>Literally "What does it give?"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">I also {explored}<note>Literally "I searched in my mind"</note> {the effects of indulging my flesh}<note>Literally "to cheer my flesh"</note> with wine. My mind guiding me with wisdom, {I investigated}<note>Literally "laid hold of"</note> folly so that I might discover what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good under heaven<note>Follows MT; two medieval Hebrew manuscripts, LXX, Peshitta read, "under the sun," cf. 1:3, 9, etc.</note> for {humans}<note>Literally "the sons of the man"</note> to do {during the days of their lives}.<note>Literally "the number of the days of their lives"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="4">{I accomplished great things}.<note>Literally "I made great my works"</note> I built for myself houses; I planted for myself vineyards.</verse>
    <verse num="5">I made for myself gardens and parks, and I planted all <transChange type="added">sorts of</transChange> fruit trees in them.</verse>
    <verse num="6">I made for myself pools of water from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees.</verse>
    <verse num="7">I acquired male slaves and female slaves, as well as children <transChange type="added">born in my</transChange> house. I also had livestock, cattle, and flocks more than anyone who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> before me in Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="8">I also gathered to myself silver and gold--the royal and provincial treasuries. I acquired for myself male and female singers, as well as the delight of {men},<note>Literally "the sons of the man"</note> {voluptuous concubines}.<note>Literally "a breast and breasts," as a synecdoche for beautiful women in the king's harem</note> </verse>
    <verse num="9">Thus, {I accomplished far more}<note>Literally "I became great and I surpassed"</note> than anyone who <transChange type="added">was</transChange> before me in Jerusalem--indeed, my wisdom stood by me.</verse>
    <verse num="10">I neither withheld anything from my eyes that they desired, nor did I deprive any pleasure from my heart. My heart rejoiced in all my toil, for this was my reward from all my toil.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Yet when I considered<note>Or "turned to"</note> all the effort which I expended and the toil with which I toiled to do, then behold, "Everything <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity and chasing wind! There is nothing profitable under the sun!" </verse>
    <verse num="12">Next, I considered wisdom, as well as delusion and folly. What can anyone <transChange type="added">do</transChange> who will come after the king that has not already been done?</verse>
    <verse num="13">I realized that wisdom has an advantage over folly, just as light has an advantage over darkness.</verse>
    <verse num="14">{The wise man can see where he is walking},<note>Literally "The eyes of the wise <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in his head"</note> but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I also realized that both of them suffer the same fate.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So I said {to myself},<note>Literally "in my heart"</note> "{If I also suffer the same fate as the fool},<note>Literally "Just as the fate of the fool--so it will happen to me!"</note> {what advantage is my great wisdom}?"<note>Literally "why have I been so exceedingly wise?"</note> So I said {to myself},<note>Literally "in my heart"</note> "This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity!" </verse>
    <verse num="16">Certainly no one will remember the wise man or the fool in {future generations}.<note>Literally "the futures"</note> When <transChange type="added">future</transChange> days come, both will have been forgotten already. How <transChange type="added">is it that</transChange> the wise man dies the same as the fool?</verse>
    <verse num="17">So I hated life because the work done under the sun <transChange type="added">is</transChange> grievous to me. For everything <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity and chasing wind! </verse>
    <verse num="18">So I hated all my toil with which I have toiled under the sun, for I must leave it behind to someone who will be after me.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And who knows <transChange type="added">whether</transChange> he will be wise or foolish? Yet he will exercise control of all <transChange type="added">the fruit of</transChange> my toil with which I toiled wisely under the sun. This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity! </verse>
    <verse num="20">So {I began to despair}<note>Literally "I myself turned to cause my heart to despair"</note> of all the toil with which I toiled under the sun.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For although a person may toil with great wisdom and skill, he must leave his reward to someone who has not toiled for it. This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity and a great calamity.</verse>
    <verse num="22">For what does a person receive for all his toil and in the longing of his heart with which he toils under the sun?</verse>
    <verse num="23">All his days <transChange type="added">are</transChange> painful, his labor <transChange type="added">brings</transChange> grief, and his heart cannot rest at night. This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity! </verse>
    <verse num="24">There is nothing better for a person than to eat and drink and {find delight}<note>Literally "to see good"</note> in his toil. For I also realized that this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> from the hand of God!</verse>
    <verse num="25">For who can eat <transChange type="added">and drink</transChange>, and who can enjoy <transChange type="added">life</transChange> apart from him?<note>The MT reads "more than me," which is supported by Aramaic Targum and Latin Vulgate, but several medieval Hebrew manuscripts read "from him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="26">For to the person who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good in his eyes, he gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and heaping up only to give <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to <transChange type="added">him who is</transChange> pleasing to him. This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity and chasing wind! </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">For everything there <transChange type="added">is</transChange> an appointed time, a time for every matter under heaven: </verse>
    <verse num="2">a time to bear<note>Or "a time to be born"; MT reads the active form "to bear <transChange type="added">children</transChange>"</note> and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to root up <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> planted;</verse>
    <verse num="3">a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break down and a time to build up;</verse>
    <verse num="4">a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance;</verse>
    <verse num="5">a time to throw away stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
    <verse num="6">a time to seek and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to throw away;</verse>
    <verse num="7">a time to tear and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak;</verse>
    <verse num="8">a time to love and a time to hate; a time <transChange type="added">for</transChange> war and a time <transChange type="added">for</transChange> peace.</verse>
    <verse num="9">What does the worker gain in his toil? </verse>
    <verse num="10">I have seen the busyness God gives to {humans}<note>Literally "the sons of the man"</note> to preoccupy<note>Or "to be busy"</note> them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">He has made everything suitable in its time. He also has put {the past}<note>Literally "eternity"</note> in their hearts, yet no one can grasp what God does from the beginning to the end.</verse>
    <verse num="12">So I realized that there is {nothing better}<note>Literally "no good"</note> for them than to {rejoice and enjoy themselves}<note>Literally "to rejoice and to do good"</note> during their lives.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And for anyone to eat and drink, that is, {to enjoy the fruit of all his toil},<note>Literally "to see good in all his toil"</note> this also is a gift of God. </verse>
    <verse num="14">I know everything God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, and nothing can be taken from it, for God so acts that humans<note>Or "they"</note> might stand in awe before him.</verse>
    <verse num="15">What is--it already was, and what will be--it already is, for {God will do what he has done.}<note>Literally "God seeks <transChange type="added">what</transChange> is pursued"</note></verse>
    <verse num="16">I saw something else under the sun: instead of justice <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> evil; instead of righteousness <transChange type="added">there was</transChange> wickedness.</verse>
    <verse num="17">So I said {to myself},<note>Literally "in my heart"</note> "God will surely judge the righteous and the wicked, for he has appointed<note>The MT reads שָׁם "there," but repointing to שָׂם, "he has appointed," makes better sense</note> a time <transChange type="added">of judgment</transChange> for every deed and every work." </verse>
    <verse num="18">I said to myself concerning {humans},<note>Literally "the sons of the man"</note> "God sifts<note>Or "tests"</note> them in order to show<note>The MT reads active "to see," but causative "to show" is reflected by LXX, Syriac Peshitta, and Latin Vulgate</note> them that they are like beasts."</verse>
    <verse num="19">For the fate of {humans}<note>Literally "the sons of the man"</note> and the fate of the beast is {the same}.<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">is</transChange> one"</note> The death of the one is like the death of the other, for {both are mortal}.<note>Literally "and one breath <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for all"</note> Man has no advantage over the beast, for both are fleeting.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Both go to one place--both came from dust and both return to dust.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For no one knows <transChange type="added">whether</transChange> the spirit of a human ascends <transChange type="added">to heaven</transChange> and <transChange type="added">whether</transChange> the spirit of the beast descends to the ground! </verse>
    <verse num="22">So I concluded that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy <transChange type="added">the fruit of</transChange> his labor, for this is his lot in life. {For no one knows what will happen in the future.}<note>Literally "For who can bring him to see in what will be after him?"</note> </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">I looked again, and I saw all the oppression that occurs under the sun. </verse>
    <verse num="2">So I deemed the dead who have already died more <transChange type="added">fortunate</transChange> than the living who are still alive.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But better <transChange type="added">off</transChange> than both of them is the one who has not yet been born and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.</verse>
    <verse num="4">I also realized that all <transChange type="added">of the</transChange> toil and all <transChange type="added">of</transChange> the skillful work that is done--it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> envy between one man and {another}.<note>Literally "his friend"</note> This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity and chasing wind! </verse>
    <verse num="5">{The fool refuses to work with his hands, so he has nothing to eat except his own skin}!<note>Literally "The fool folds his hands and eats his flesh"</note></verse>
    <verse num="6">Better <transChange type="added">is</transChange> one handful with peace than two fists full with toil and chasing wind.</verse>
    <verse num="7">I turned again and saw another vanity under the sun.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Sometimes a man is all alone with no companion; he also has neither son nor brother. Yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eye is not satisfied with wealth. <transChange type="added">He laments,</transChange> "For whom am I toiling and depriving {myself}<note>Literally "his soul"</note> of pleasure?" This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity--it is an unhappy business! </verse>
    <verse num="9">Two <transChange type="added">are</transChange> better than the one, for they enjoy a better reward for their toil.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For if one falls, his companion may help him up. But pity the one who falls and there is {no one}<note>Literally "there is not a second"</note> to help him up.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Also if two lie together, {they can keep each other warm}.<note>Literally "and it will be warm for them"</note> But how can one person be warm?</verse>
    <verse num="12">{Although an assailant may overpower one person, two may withstand him}.<note>Literally "And even though he will prevail against him, the one; the second, they will withstand opposite him"</note> A threefold cord {is not easily broken}!<note>Literally "will not be broken in haste"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="13">A poor but wise youth <transChange type="added">is</transChange> better than an old but foolish king who no longer knows {how to receive advice}.<note>Literally "how to be warned"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">For he came out of the prison house to reign, {since he was born poor in his kingdom}.<note>Literally "for all in his kingdom he was born poor"</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">I saw all the living who move about under the sun with the youth; the second who will stand in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="16">There is no end to all the people, to all who were before him. Yet the later generation will not rejoice in him, for this also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity and chasing wind! </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1"><note>Ecclesiastes 5:1-20 in the English Bible is 4:17-5:19 in the Hebrew Bible</note> Guard your steps when you go to the house of God; draw near to listen <transChange type="added">rather</transChange> than to offer a sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Do not be rash with your mouth, and do not let your heart be quick to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven, and you <transChange type="added">are</transChange> on earth; therefore, let your words be few.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For a dream comes with many cares, and the voice of a fool with many words.</verse>
    <verse num="4">When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it, for {he takes no pleasure}<note>Literally "there is no desire"</note> in fools. Fulfill what you vow!</verse>
    <verse num="5">It is better that you not vow than that you vow and not fulfill it.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Do not let your mouth lead your flesh into sin, and do not tell the messenger that it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a mistake. Why anger God at your words, so that he destroys the work of your hands?</verse>
    <verse num="7">For with many dreams <transChange type="added">come</transChange> vanities and numerous words. Therefore, fear God!</verse>
    <verse num="8">Do not be surprised if you see the poor being oppressed with violence or <transChange type="added">do not see</transChange> justice and righteousness in the province. For one official is watched by a higher official, and <transChange type="added">there are</transChange> even higher officials over them!</verse>
    <verse num="9">The produce of the land is exploited by everyone; {even the king profits from the field <transChange type="added">of the poor</transChange>}!<note>Literally "for the field is even worked for the king"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">Whoever loves money is not satisfied <transChange type="added">with</transChange> money, and whoever loves wealth <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not <transChange type="added">satisfied with</transChange> profit. This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity!</verse>
    <verse num="11">When prosperity increases, those who consume it increase. {So its owner gains nothing, except to see his wealth before it is spent}.<note>Literally "And what gain has its owner but to see it with his eyes?"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">The sleep of the laborer <transChange type="added">is</transChange> pleasant, whether he eats little or much, but the wealth of the rich man does not allow him to rest.</verse>
    <verse num="13">There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth {hoarded}<note>Literally "kept "</note> by its owner to his harm.</verse>
    <verse num="14">That wealth was lost in a bad venture. Although he has borne a child, {he has nothing to leave to him}.<note>Literally "he has nothing in his hand"</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">Just as he came from his mother's womb naked, {he will depart}<note>Literally "return to go"</note> just as he came; he will take nothing with him for his toil.</verse>
    <verse num="16">This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a grievous illness. Exactly as he came, so he will go. What profit <transChange type="added">does</transChange> he gain for all his toil for the wind?</verse>
    <verse num="17">Also, he eats in darkness all his days; he is frustrated <transChange type="added">in</transChange> much sickness and resentment. </verse>
    <verse num="18">Look! I have discovered what is good and fitting: to eat and to drink and {to enjoy}<note>Literally "to see goodness"</note> all <transChange type="added">the fruit of</transChange> the toil with which one toils under the sun during the number of the days of his life that God gives to him--for this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his lot.<note>Or "fate"</note></verse>
    <verse num="19">This indeed is a gift of God: everyone to whom God gives wealth and possessions, he also empowers him {to enjoy them},<note>Literally "to eat from it"</note> to accept his lot, and to rejoice in <transChange type="added">the fruit of</transChange> his toil.</verse>
    <verse num="20">For he does not remember the <transChange type="added">brief</transChange> days of his life, for God keeps his heart preoccupied with enjoyment <transChange type="added">of life</transChange>. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Here is another misfortune that I have seen under the sun, and it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> prevalent among humankind.</verse>
    <verse num="2">God gives a man wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires; yet God does not enable him to enjoy it--instead someone else ends up enjoying it. This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity--indeed, it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a grievous ill! </verse>
    <verse num="3">Even if a man fathers a hundred <transChange type="added">children</transChange> and lives many years so that the days of his years are many, if his heart<note>Or "his soul"</note> is not satisfied with {his prosperity}<note>Literally "the good"</note> and {he does not receive a proper burial},<note>Literally "and also there is no burial for him"</note> I deem the stillborn better than him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For he comes into vanity and departs into darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He has neither seen nor known the sun, yet he has more rest than him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Even if a man<note>Hebrew "he"</note> lives a thousand years twice, if he<note>Hebrew "and"</note> does not enjoy {prosperity},<note>Literally "good"</note> {both suffer the same fate}!<note>Literally "are not the all going to the same place?"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="7">All of a man's toil <transChange type="added">is</transChange> for his mouth-- yet his appetite is never satisfied.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So do the wise <transChange type="added">really</transChange> have an advantage over fools? {Can the poor <transChange type="added">really</transChange> gain anything by knowing how to act in front of others}?<note>Literally "What <transChange type="added">is there</transChange> for the poor knowing <transChange type="added">how</transChange> to conduct themselves before the living?"</note></verse>
    <verse num="9">{Better to be content with what your eyes see than for your soul to constantly crave more}.<note>Literally "Sight of the eyes <transChange type="added">is</transChange> better than wandering of desire"</note> This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity and chasing wind!</verse>
    <verse num="10">Whatever is--it was already determined, {what will be--it has already been decided}.<note>Literally "and his name is known what he <transChange type="added">is</transChange> man"</note> As for man, he cannot argue against what is more powerful than him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">{Increasing words only multiplies futility},<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">Where</transChange> there <transChange type="added">are</transChange> numerous words, <transChange type="added">it</transChange> makes numerous vanity"</note> how does that profit anyone?</verse>
    <verse num="12">For who knows what <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good for a man in his life during the few days of his fleeting life, which are fleeting as a shadow? For who can tell anyone what will happen {in the future}<note>Literally "after him"</note> under the sun? </verse>

  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">A good name <transChange type="added">is</transChange> better than precious ointment, and the day of death <transChange type="added">is better</transChange> than the day of one's birth.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for <transChange type="added">death is</transChange> the end of every person, and the living should take <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to his heart.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Sorrow <transChange type="added">is</transChange> better than laughter, for by sadness of countenance the heart is made good.</verse>
    <verse num="4">The heart of the wise <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in the house of mirth.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Better to listen to <transChange type="added">the</transChange> rebuke of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> wise than for a man to listen to <transChange type="added">the</transChange> song of fools.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Like the sound of thorns under a pot, so also the laughter of fools. This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity!</verse>

    <verse num="13">Consider the work of God. For who is able to make straight what he made crooked?</verse>
    <verse num="14">In the day of prosperity, rejoice! But in the day of adversity, consider! For God made one in place of another so that mortals cannot find out what will happen {in the future}.<note>Literally "after him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">I have seen all these things in my vain life: Sometimes a righteous man perishes in <transChange type="added">spite of</transChange> his righteousness, and sometimes a wicked man lives a long life in <transChange type="added">spite of</transChange> his evil.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Do not be excessively<note>Or "abundantly"</note> righteous, and do not act excessively wise, lest you destroy yourself.</verse>

    <verse num="20">Surely there is no one righteous on the earth who <transChange type="added">continually</transChange> does good and never sins.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Do not pay attention to everything people say, lest you hear your own servant curse you.</verse>
    <verse num="22">For your heart knows that you also have cursed others many times.</verse>
    <verse num="23">All this I have tested with wisdom. I said, "I will be wise!" but {it was beyond my grasp}.<note>Literally "it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> far from me"</note></verse>
    <verse num="24">{Whatever is--it is far beyond comprehension}.<note>Literally "That which is--it <transChange type="added">is</transChange> far and deep deep"</note> Who can discover it? </verse>
    <verse num="25">I set my mind to try to seek wisdom and the plan, and to know that wickedness <transChange type="added">is</transChange> foolishness and that folly <transChange type="added">is</transChange> delusion.</verse>
    <verse num="26">I myself found <transChange type="added">that</transChange> more bitter than death <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the woman who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a trap, whose heart <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a snare, and whose hands <transChange type="added">are</transChange> bonds.

  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">Who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like the sage? Who knows <transChange type="added">the</transChange> interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Keep <transChange type="added">the</transChange> command of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> king<note>While MT reads "I <transChange type="added">said</transChange>, 'Keep <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mouth of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> king,'" the versions read "Keep <transChange type="added">the</transChange> mouth of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> king," which is adopted in the translation</note> {because of your oath to God}.<note>Literally "because of the oath of God"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">Do not be terrified of his presence! Go at once and do not delay when a matter <transChange type="added">is</transChange> unpleasant, for he can do anything that he desires.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Since the word of the king <transChange type="added">is</transChange> supreme, no one can say to him, "What are you doing?"</verse>
    <verse num="5">Whoever obeys <transChange type="added">his</transChange> command will not suffer disaster. The wise mind knows the <transChange type="added">proper</transChange> time and the right <transChange type="added">procedure</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For there is a <transChange type="added">proper</transChange> time and right <transChange type="added">procedure</transChange> for every matter, even though the trouble of man <transChange type="added">weighs</transChange> heavy upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Surely no one knows what will be, so who can tell anyone what will happen?</verse>
    <verse num="8">Just as no one can control the wind to restrain the wind, so also no one can control the day of his death. Just as no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not deliver the wicked.</verse>
    <verse num="9">I saw all this as I applied my heart to all the deeds done under the sun: {sometimes those in authority harm others}.<note>Literally "sometimes one man domineers another man to his harm"</note></verse>
    <verse num="10">Meanwhile, I saw the wicked being <transChange type="added">honorably</transChange> buried, but those who came and went from the holy place were forgotten in the city, even though they had done so. This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity! </verse>
    <verse num="11">Because sentence against an evil deed is not carried out quickly, the heart of {humans}<note>Literally "the sons of the man"</note> fills up within them to do evil.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Although the sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I also know that it will be good for those who fear God--because they fear {his presence}.<note>Literally "from before his face"</note></verse>
    <verse num="13">But it will not go well with the wicked, and they will not prolong <transChange type="added">their</transChange> days, like the shadow; because there is no fearing {God's presence}.<note>Literally "from before the face of God"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">There <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a vanity that happens on earth: sometimes the righteous suffer what the wicked deserve, and sometimes the wicked receive what the righteous deserve. I said, "This also <transChange type="added">is</transChange> vanity!" </verse>
    <verse num="15">So I recommend enjoyment. For there <transChange type="added">is</transChange> nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and to drink and to rejoice. This will accompany him in his toil the days of his life that God gives to him under the sun. </verse>
    <verse num="16">I applied my mind to know wisdom and to understand the business that is done on earth--how neither day nor night one's eyes see sleep.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then I saw all the work of God--man <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not able to discover the work that is done under the sun. Although man may toil in seeking, he cannot find it. Even if a wise man claims <transChange type="added">that he</transChange> knows it, he cannot find it. </verse>

  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">So all this I laid to my heart, and I concluded<note>Or "examined"</note> that the righteous and the wise, as well as their deeds, <transChange type="added">are</transChange> in the hand of God. So no one knows anything that will <transChange type="added">come</transChange> to them, whether <transChange type="added">it will be</transChange> love or hatred.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The same fate <transChange type="added">comes</transChange> to everyone: </verse>
    <verse num="3">This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the {injustice}<note>Literally "evil"</note> that is done under the sun: the same fate <transChange type="added">comes</transChange> to everyone. Also the hearts of {humans}<note>Literally "the sons of the man"</note> are full <transChange type="added">of</transChange> evil; delusion <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in their hearts during their lives, and then they die.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Whoever is joined<note>The Kethib reads "chosen," but the Qere as well as all the versions and numerous medieval Hebrew manuscripts read "joined"</note> to all the living has hope. After all, even a live dog is better than a dead lion!</verse>

    <verse num="6">What they loved and hated, as well as what they desired, has already perished. They no longer have any share in what is done under the sun. </verse>
    <verse num="7">Go--eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart! For God already has approved your deeds.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Always be clothed in white garments, and never let your head lack oil!</verse>
    <verse num="9">Enjoy life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which he gives you under the sun, because this <transChange type="added">is</transChange> your lot in life and in the toil with which you toil under the sun.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Whatever your hand finds to do--do <transChange type="added">it</transChange> with <transChange type="added">all</transChange> your might; for in Sheol--where you are going--no one works, plans, knows, or thinks about anything. </verse>
    <verse num="11">I looked again and saw under the sun that the race <transChange type="added">does</transChange> not <transChange type="added">belong</transChange> to the swift, the battle <transChange type="added">does</transChange> not <transChange type="added">belong</transChange> to the mighty, food <transChange type="added">does</transChange> not <transChange type="added">belong</transChange> to the wise, wealth <transChange type="added">does</transChange> not <transChange type="added">belong</transChange> to the intelligent, and success<note>Or "favor"</note> <transChange type="added">does</transChange> not <transChange type="added">belong</transChange> to the skillful, for time and chance befalls all of them.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For man does not know his time. Just as fish are caught in a cruel net and like birds who are seized in a snare, so also {humans}<note>Literally "the sons of the man"</note> are ensnared at a cruel time when it falls suddenly upon them. </verse>
    <verse num="13">I have also seen this <transChange type="added">example of</transChange> wisdom under the sun, and it <transChange type="added">seemed</transChange> great to me.</verse>
    <verse num="14"><transChange type="added">There was</transChange> a small city with few people in it. A great king came and besieged it, building great siege works against it.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now, a poor wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city by his wisdom.</verse>
    <verse num="16">So I concluded that wisdom <transChange type="added">is</transChange> better than might, yet the wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard. </verse>
    <verse num="17">The words of the wise are heard in peace <transChange type="added">more</transChange> than the shouting of a ruler <transChange type="added">is heard</transChange> among the fools.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Wisdom <transChange type="added">is</transChange> better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</verse>

  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">Dead flies cause a bad smell <transChange type="added">and</transChange> ruin<note>Or "spew"</note> the ointment of the perfumer. So also a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The heart of the wise <transChange type="added">inclines</transChange> to his right, but the heart of the fool <transChange type="added">inclines</transChange> to his left.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Even when the fool walks along the road, he lacks sense; he tells everyone <transChange type="added">that</transChange> he is a fool.</verse>

    <verse num="14">The fool {talks too much},<note>Literally "increases words"</note> for no one knows what will be. Who can tell anyone what will happen {in the future}?<note>Literally "after him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="15">The fool is so worn out by a hard day's work {he cannot even find his way home at night}.<note>Or "for he knows not to go to a city"</note></verse>
