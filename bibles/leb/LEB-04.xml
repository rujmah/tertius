    <verse num="10">Moses heard the people weeping according to their<note>Hebrew "its"</note> clans, each at the doorway of their tents. Then {Yahweh became very angry},<note>Literally "the nose of Yahweh became very hot"</note> and in the eyes of Moses it was bad.</verse>

    <verse num="16">And Yahweh said to Moses, "Gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel whom you know <transChange type="added">are</transChange> elders of the people and their<note>Hebrew "his/its"</note> officials; take them to the tent of assembly, and they will stand there with you.</verse>
    <verse num="17">I will come down and speak with you there; I will take away from the spirit that <transChange type="added">is</transChange> on you, and I will place <transChange type="added">it</transChange> on them; and they will bear the burdens of the people with you; you will not bear it alone.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And you will say to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves tomorrow, for you will eat meat because you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, "Who will feed us good meat? <transChange type="added">It was</transChange> good for us in Egypt."

    <verse num="19">You will eat, not one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,</verse>
    <verse num="20">{but for a whole month},<note>Literally "until a period of one month"</note> until it comes out from your nose and becomes as nausea to you; because you have rejected Yahweh, who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> in your midst, and you wept before {his presence},<note>Literally "before his face"</note> saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"

    <verse num="21">But Moses said, "<transChange type="added">There are</transChange> six hundred thousand on foot, among whom I <transChange type="added">am</transChange> in the midst, and you yourself said, 'I will give meat to them, and they will eat for a whole month.'</verse>

    <verse num="24">So Moses went out, and he spoke the words of Yahweh to the people, and he gathered <transChange type="added">together</transChange> seventy men from the elders of the people, and he {made them stand}<note>Literally "caused them to stand"</note> all around the tent.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Yahweh went down in the cloud and spoke to him, and he took away the spirit that <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on him, and he {put it}<note>Or "gave it"</note> on the seventy elders.

    <verse num="26">But two men were left in the camp; the name of one <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Eldad, and the name of the second <transChange type="added">was</transChange> Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those who were written <transChange type="added">down</transChange>, but they did not go out to the tent, so they prophesied in the camp.</verse>
    <verse num="27">So a boy<note>Hebrew "the boy"</note> ran and told Moses and said, "Eldad and Medad <transChange type="added">are</transChange> prophesying in the camp."</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from time of his youth, answered, "Moses, my lord, stop them."</verse>

    <verse num="30">Then Moses and the elders of Israel were gathered to the camp. </verse>
    <verse num="31">Then a wind set out from Yahweh, and it drove quails from the west, and he spread <transChange type="added">them</transChange> out on the camp about a day's journey on one side and about a day's journey on the other, all around the camp, about two cubits on the surface of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And so the people {worked}<note>Literally "arose"</note> all day and all night and all the next day, and they gathered the quail (the least of the ones collecting gathered ten homers).<note>HALOT 330, "a dry measure"</note></verse>
    <verse num="33">While the meat <transChange type="added">was</transChange> still between their teeth, before it was consumed, Yahweh was angry with the people, and Yahweh struck a very great plague among the people.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah<note>Hebrew "the graves of greediness"</note> because they buried the people that {were greedy}.<note>Literally "craved"</note></verse>
    <verse num="35">From Kibroth Hattaavah<note>Hebrew "the graves of greediness"</note> the people set out <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Hazeroth; and they stayed<note>Hebrew "they were"</note> in Hazeroth. </verse>

    <verse num="1">Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Reuben,</verse>

    <verse num="4">When Moses heard <transChange type="added">this</transChange>, he fell on his face.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he said to Korah and to his entire company, saying, "<transChange type="added">Tomorrow</transChange> morning Yahweh will make known who <transChange type="added">is</transChange> his and <transChange type="added">who</transChange> is holy, and he will bring him near to him, whomever he chooses he will bring near to him.</verse>

    <verse num="12">Moses sent to call <transChange type="added">for</transChange> Dathan and Abiram son of Eliab, but they said, "We will not come!<note>Hebrew "We will not come up!"</note></verse>

    <verse num="32">The land opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their houses and every person {that belonged to Korah}<note>Literally "that was to Korah"</note> and all the property.</verse>

    <verse num="36"><note>Numbers 16:36-17:13 in the English Bible is 17:1-28 in the Hebrew Bible</note> And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="41">The next day all the community of the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of Yahweh!"</verse>

    <verse num="49">Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died on account of Korah.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="33">Then they turned and went up <transChange type="added">by</transChange> the way of the Bashan, and Og king of the Bashan and all his people went out to meet them for battle <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Edrei.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And Yahweh said to Moses, "Do not fear him because I will give him and all his people and all his land into your hand. You will do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,<note>Hebrew "Amorite"</note> who was living in Heshbon."</verse>
    <verse num="35">And so they destroyed him and his sons, and all his people until they had not spared a survivor; and they took possession of his land. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">The {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> set out, and they encamped on the desert-plateau of Moab, across from Jericho beyond <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Jordan.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel did to the Amorites,<note>Hebrew "Amorite"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">and Moab was very terrified in the presence of the people because {they}<note>Hebrew "he" or "it"</note> <transChange type="added">were</transChange> numerous; and Moab dreaded the presence of the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note></verse>
    <verse num="4">And Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now the crowd will lick up all around us, like a bull devours the grass of the field." And Balak son of Zippor <transChange type="added">was</transChange> king of Moab at that time.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor <transChange type="added">at</transChange> Pethor, which <transChange type="added">is</transChange> by the river,<note>That is, the Euphrates</note> in the land of the children of his people, to summon him, saying, "Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover {the surface of the land};<note>Literally "the eye of the land"</note> they <transChange type="added">are about</transChange> to dwell opposite me.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Now, please go, curse this people for me because they<note>Hebrew "he"</note> <transChange type="added">are</transChange> stronger than me; perhaps I will be able to strike them<note>Hebrew "he"</note> and drive them<note>Hebrew "he"</note> out from the land because I know whoever you bless <transChange type="added">is</transChange> blessed, and whoever you cursed is cursed." </verse>
    <verse num="7">So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went <transChange type="added">with</transChange> a fee for divination in their hand; they came to Balaam and spoke the words of Balak to him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">He said to them, "Spend the night here, and I will return, and I will return word to you, just as Yahweh speaks to me." So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And God came to Balaam and said, "Who <transChange type="added">are</transChange> these men with you?"</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent <transChange type="added">word</transChange> to me,</verse>
    <verse num="11">'Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover {the surface of the land}.<note>Literally "the eye of the land"</note> Now, go, curse them<note>Hebrew "him"</note> for me. Perhaps I will be able to attack them<note>Hebrew "him"</note> and drive them<note>Hebrew "him"</note> out."</verse>
    <verse num="12">God said to Balaam, "You will not go with them; you will not curse the people, because they<note>Hebrew "he"</note> <transChange type="added">are</transChange> blessed."</verse>
    <verse num="13">Balaam got up in the morning, and he said to the princes of Balak, "Go to your land, because Yahweh refused to allow me to go with you."</verse>
    <verse num="14">The princes of Moab got up and went to Balak, and they said, "Balaam refused to come with us." </verse>
    <verse num="15">Balak again sent many princes, <transChange type="added">who were more</transChange> honored {than the former}.<note>Literally "than these"</note></verse>
    <verse num="16">They came to Balaam and said to him, "Thus says Balak son of Zippor, 'Please, let nothing keep you from coming to me</verse>
    <verse num="17">because I will surely honor you greatly, and all that you say to me I will do. Please, come; curse this people for me.'"</verse>
    <verse num="18">Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, "Even though Balak gives to me his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond {the command of Yahweh}<note>Literally "the mouth of Yahweh"</note> my God to do a little or a lot.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And now please, {you also stay here}<note>Literally "please stay in this"</note> the night, and {let me find out}<note>Literally "let me know"</note> again what Yahweh will say with me."</verse>
    <verse num="20">And God came to Balaam <transChange type="added">at</transChange> night, and he said to him, "If the men have come to call you, get up <transChange type="added">and</transChange> go with them; but only the word that I will speak to you, you will do."</verse>
    <verse num="21">So Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey, and he went with the princes of Moab. </verse>
    <verse num="22">But {God became angry}<note>Literally "God's nose became hot"</note> because he was going, and the angel of Yahweh stood in the road as an adversary to him; he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> riding on his donkey, and two servants were with him.</verse>
    <verse num="23">The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and the donkey turned aside from the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the road.</verse>
    <verse num="24">The angel of Yahweh stood in the narrow path of the vineyards, <transChange type="added">with</transChange> {a wall on either side}.<note>Literally "a wall from this and a wall from this"</note></verse>
    <verse num="25">When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she pressed herself into the wall, and she pressed the foot of Balaam into the wall, so he struck her again.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then the angel of Yahweh went further ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was not a way to turn aside <transChange type="added">to the</transChange> right or left.</verse>
    <verse num="27">When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she lay down under Balaam, so {Balaam became angry},<note>Literally "Balaam's nose became hot"</note> and he struck the donkey with <transChange type="added">his</transChange> staff.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What did I do to you that you struck me these three times?"</verse>
    <verse num="29">Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you made a mockery of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!"</verse>
    <verse num="30">The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?" He said, "No." </verse>
    <verse num="31">Then Yahweh exposed the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and he bowed down and worshiped to his face.</verse>
    <verse num="32">The angel of Yahweh said to him, "Why have you struck this donkey three times? Look, I have come out as an adversary because your conduct is perverse before me.</verse>
    <verse num="33">The donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from my face, then I would have killed you and kept her alive."</verse>
    <verse num="34">Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, "I have sinned because I did not know that you <transChange type="added">were</transChange> standing to meet me in the road. Now, {if it is displeasing to you},<note>Literally "if it is evil in your eyes"</note> I will turn back."</verse>
    <verse num="35">The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only the word that I will speak to you." So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. </verse>
    <verse num="36">When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him by the city of Moab, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on the boundary of Aaron at the end of the territory.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not urgently send to meet with you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to honor you?"</verse>
    <verse num="38">Balaam said to Balak, "Look, I came to you now. Am I really able to speak anything at all? I speak the word that God puts in my mouth."</verse>
    <verse num="39">Balaam went with Balak, and they came <transChange type="added">to</transChange> Kiriath-Huzoth.</verse>
    <verse num="40">And Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he sent <transChange type="added">them</transChange> to Balaam and to the princes who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And it happened, in the morning Balak took Balaam and took him up to Bamoth-Baal, and he saw from there the end of the nation. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="23">
    <verse num="1">Balaam said to Balak, "Build for me this: seven altars. And prepare for me this: seven bulls and seven rams."</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Balak did just as Balaam spoke, and Balak offered Balaam a bull and a ram on the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Balaam said to Balak, "Station yourself at your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell to you." So he went <transChange type="added">to</transChange> a barren height. </verse>
    <verse num="4">And God met with Balaam, and he said to him, "I have arranged seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on the altar."</verse>
    <verse num="5">Yahweh put a word in the mouth of Balaam and said, "Return to Balak, and you must speak thus."</verse>
    <verse num="6">So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he lifted up his oracle and said, </verse>
    <verse num="8">How can I curse <transChange type="added">whom</transChange> God has not cursed, and how can I denounce <transChange type="added">whom</transChange> Yahweh has not denounced?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Because from the top of <transChange type="added">the</transChange> rocks I see him, from hilltops I watch him. Behold, a people <transChange type="added">who</transChange> dwell alone, they do not consider themselves among the nations.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Who can count the dust of Jacob, or <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a number the fourth part of Israel? Let my life die the death of an upright person, and let my end be like his!"</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have surely blessed them!"</verse>
    <verse num="12">He answered and said, "{Should I not speak}<note>Literally "Should I not observe to speak"</note> what Yahweh puts in my mouth?" </verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Balak said, "Please walk with me to another place where you will see them, <transChange type="added">but</transChange> you will only see part of them and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there."</verse>
    <verse num="14">So he took him to the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah, and he built seven altars, and he offered a bull and a ram on <transChange type="added">each</transChange> altar.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Balaam<note>Hebrew "He"</note> said to Balak, "Station yourself here at the burnt offering while I myself meet with <transChange type="added">Yahweh</transChange> there."</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then Yahweh met with Balaam, and he put a word in his mouth, and he said, "Return to Balak, and you must speak thus."</verse>
    <verse num="17">He came to him, and behold, he <transChange type="added">was</transChange> standing at his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, "What has Yahweh spoken?"</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then {he uttered}<note>Literally "he lifted up"</note> his oracle, and said, </verse>
    <verse num="19">God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of humankind, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do <transChange type="added">it</transChange>? And has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?</verse>
    <verse num="20">Behold, I have received <transChange type="added">a command</transChange> to bless; when he has blessed, I cannot cause it to return.</verse>
    <verse num="21">He has no regard <transChange type="added">for</transChange> evil in Jacob, and he does not see trouble in Israel; Yahweh his God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> with him, and a shout<note>Or "a blast"</note> of a king <transChange type="added">is</transChange> among them.<note>Hebrew "him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="22">God, who brings them out from Egypt, <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like the strength<note>Or "like the horns"</note> of a wild ox for them.<note>Hebrew "him"</note></verse>
    <verse num="23">Because <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> no sorcery against Jacob, and <transChange type="added">there is</transChange> no divination against Israel. Now<note>Or "At the right time"</note> it will be said to Jacob and Israel, what God has done!</verse>
    <verse num="24">Look! <transChange type="added">the</transChange> people will rise like the lion; he raises himself and will not lie down until he eats <transChange type="added">the</transChange> prey and drinks the blood of the slain."</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them<note>Hebrew "him"</note> at all, nor bless them<note>Hebrew "him"</note> at all!"</verse>
    <verse num="26">But Balaam answered and said to Balak, "Did I not speak to you, saying, 'Whatever Yahweh speaks I will do'?" </verse>
    <verse num="27">Then Balak said to Balaam, "Please, come, I will take you to another place; perhaps {it will be acceptable to}<note>Literally "it will be right in the eyes of"</note> God, and you will curse for me from there."</verse>
    <verse num="28">So Balak took Balaam <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the top of Peor, which looks down on the face of the Jeshimon.<note>Or "the wasteland"</note></verse>
    <verse num="29">And Balaam said to Balak, "Build for me these seven altars, and prepare for me these seven bulls and seven rams."</verse>
    <verse num="30">Balak did just as Balaam said, and he offered a bull and a ram on <transChange type="added">each</transChange> altar. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="24">
    <verse num="1">And Balaam saw that {it pleased}<note>Literally "it was good in the eyes of Yahweh"</note> Yahweh to bless Israel, and he did not go {as other times}<note>Literally "as time on time"</note> {to seek out}<note>Literally "to meet"</note> sorcery; instead, he set his face toward the desert.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Balaam lift up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to its tribes, and the spirit of God was upon it.<note>That is, Israel</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">He {uttered}<note>Literally "lifted up"</note> his oracle and said, </verse>
    <verse num="4">the declaration of the hearer of God's words,<note>Or "God's sayings"</note> who sees the revelation of Shaddai,<note>Often translated "the Almighty"</note> falling down but <transChange type="added">whose</transChange> eyes are uncovered.</verse>

    <verse num="6">They are spread out like valleys, like gardens on a river, like aloes planted by Yahweh, like cedars at <transChange type="added">the</transChange> waters.</verse>
    <verse num="7">He will pour water from his buckets, and his offspring <transChange type="added">will be</transChange> like many waters; his king will be higher than Agag, and his kingdom will be exalted.</verse>
    <verse num="8">God, who brings him out from Egypt, <transChange type="added">is</transChange> like the strength<note>Or "the horns"</note> of a wild ox for him.

    <verse num="9">He crouches, he lies down like a lion, and like a lioness, who will rouse him? <transChange type="added">They who</transChange> bless you will be blessed, and <transChange type="added">they who</transChange> curse you will be cursed."</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then {Balak became angry with}<note>Literally "the nose of Balak became hot against"</note> Balaam, and he clapped his hands and said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, but look, you have surely blessed <transChange type="added">them</transChange> these three times.</verse>
    <verse num="11">{Flee}<note>Literally "Flee for yourself"</note> to your place now. I said I would richly honor you, but look, Yahweh has withheld honor from you."</verse>
    <verse num="12">Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="17">I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; a star will go out from Jacob, and a scepter will rise from Israel; it will crush the foreheads of Moab and destroy all the children of Seth.</verse>

    <verse num="21">And he looked <transChange type="added">at</transChange> the Kenites,<note>Hebrew "Kenite"</note> {uttered}<note>Literally "lifted up"</note> his oracle, and said, </verse>

  <chapter num="30">
    <verse num="1">Then Moses spoke to {the leaders}<note>Literally "the heads"</note> of the tribes concerning the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> saying, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the word that Yahweh commanded:</verse>
    <verse num="2">if a man makes a vow for Yahweh or swears an oath with a binding pledge on himself, he must not render his word invalid; he must do all that went out from his mouth. </verse>
    <verse num="3">"If a woman makes a vow to Yahweh, and she binds a pledge <transChange type="added">on herself</transChange> in her father's house in your childhood,</verse>
    <verse num="4">but if her father hears her vow or her pledge that she bound on herself and says nothing to her, then all her vows will stand, and every pledge that she binds on her life will stand.</verse>
    <verse num="5">If her father forbids her on the day he hears <transChange type="added">of it</transChange>, all her vows or her pledges that she bound on herself will not stand, and Yahweh will forgive her because her father has forgiven her. </verse>
    <verse num="6">"If {she has a husband}<note>Literally "she is to a man"</note> while bound by her vows or a rash promise of her lips,</verse>
    <verse num="7">and her husband hears <transChange type="added">of it</transChange> and is silent on the day he hears <transChange type="added">it</transChange>, her vows will stand, and her pledge that she bound upon herself will stand.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But if on the day her husband hears <transChange type="added">of it</transChange>, he forbids her, then he will nullify her vow that she is under, and the rash promise of her lips that she bound on herself; and Yahweh will forgive her. </verse>
    <verse num="9">"But the vow of a widow or a woman who is divorced, all that she binds on herself will stand on her.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But if she made a vow <transChange type="added">in</transChange> her husband's house, or bound herself on a pledge with a sworn oath,</verse>
    <verse num="11">and her husband heard <transChange type="added">it</transChange> but was silent to her, and he did not forbid her, all her vows will stand and every pledge that she bound on herself will stand.</verse>
    <verse num="12">But if her husband nullified them on the day he hears <transChange type="added">them</transChange>, all her vows going out of her lips concerning her vows or the pledge on herself will not stand; her husband has nullified them, and Yahweh will forgive her. </verse>
    <verse num="13">"Any vow and any sworn oath of a pledge to inflict on herself, her husband can confirm it or her husband can nullify it.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But if her husband is completely silent from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all her pledges that <transChange type="added">are</transChange> on her; he confirms them because he was silent to her on the day he heard <transChange type="added">them</transChange>.</verse>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="31">
    <verse num="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">"Seek vengeance for the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> on the Midianites; afterward you will be gathered to your people."</verse>
    <verse num="3">Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm yourself from among your men for the battle, so that they will {go}<note>Literally "be"</note> against Midian to mete out the vengeance of Yahweh on Midian.</verse>
    <verse num="4">A thousand from each tribe of every tribe of Israel you will send to battle."</verse>
    <verse num="5">So theywere assigned from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand equipped for battle.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the battle, and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the battle with them, and the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets of the blast <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And they fought against Midian just as Yahweh commanded Moses, and they killed every male.</verse>
    <verse num="8">They killed the kings of Midian in addition to the ones they had slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam son of Beor by the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="9">The {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> took captive the women of Midian and their children, and they plundered all their domestic animals and all their livestock and all their wealth.</verse>
    <verse num="10">They burned all their cities where they dwelled and all their camps with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="11">They took all the plunder and all the war-booty with the humans<note>Hebrew "human"</note> and domestic animals.<note>Hebrew "animal"</note></verse>
    <verse num="12">They brought the captives, the war-booty, and the plunder to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the community of the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> to the camp to the desert-plateau of Moab, which <transChange type="added">was</transChange> on <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Jordan <transChange type="added">across</transChange> Jericho. </verse>
    <verse num="13">And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went out to meet them outside the camp.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But Moses was angry toward the leaders of the troops, the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, who came from the battle of the war.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Moses said to them, "You have kept alive every female?</verse>
    <verse num="16">Behold, these women {caused}<note>Literally "were to"</note> the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> by the word of Balaam, to be in apostasy against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, so that the plague was among the community of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Now kill every male among the little children, and kill every woman who has {had sexual intercourse with a man}.<note>Literally "who has known the bed of a male"</note></verse>
    <verse num="18">But all the females who have not {had sexual intercourse with a man},<note>Literally "who has known the bed of a male"</note> keep alive for yourselves.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And you, camp outside the camp seven days; all who killed a person and all who touched the slain purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives.</verse>
    <verse num="20">You will purify yourselves and every garment and every object of hide and all the work of goats' hair, and every object of wood." </verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of the battle who came from the war, "This <transChange type="added">is</transChange> the decree of the law that Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead--</verse>
    <verse num="23">everything that will go through the fire--you will pass through the fire, and it will be clean, and only in waters of impurity will it be purified. Whatever does not go into the fire you will pass through the waters.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And you will wash your garments on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you will come into the camp." </verse>
    <verse num="25">Yahweh said to Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="26">"You and Eleazar the priest and the leaders of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> of the community, {take count}<note>Literally "lift up the head"</note> of the war-booty that was captured, both humans<note>Hebrew "human"</note> and the domestic animals;<note>Hebrew "animal"</note></verse>
    <verse num="27">divide the war-booty between those who engaged in the war, who went out to the battle, and all the community.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Exact a tribute for Yahweh from the men of the war, those who went out to the battle, one from five hundred persons, and from the cattle and from the male donkeys and from the flock;</verse>
    <verse num="29">take from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a contribution to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="30">From half of the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> take one <transChange type="added">share</transChange> drawn by lot from the fifty from the humans,<note>Hebrew "human"</note> from the cattle, from the male donkeys, from the flock, from all the domestic animals,<note>Hebrew "animal"</note> and give them to the Levities who keep the responsibilities of the tabernacle of Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="31">Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Yahweh commanded Moses. </verse>
    <verse num="32">Thus the war-booty that remained of the plunder that the people of the battle plundered was six hundred and seventy-five thousand flocks <transChange type="added">of sheep</transChange>,</verse>
    <verse num="33">seventy-two thousand cattle,</verse>
    <verse num="34">sixty-one thousand male donkeys,</verse>
    <verse num="35">and the life of humankind, from the women who did not {have sexual intercourse with a man},<note>Literally "who has known the bed of a male"</note> all the persons<note>Hebrew "person"</note> were thirty-two thousand. </verse>
    <verse num="36">The half of the share that was going out to the battle: the number of the flock <transChange type="added">of sheep</transChange> was thee hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred;</verse>
    <verse num="37">the tribute to Yahweh from the flock was six hundred and seventy-five;</verse>
    <verse num="38">and the cattle were thirty-six thousand; and the tribute to Yahweh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> seventy-two.</verse>
    <verse num="39">Of the male donkeys there were thirty thousand five hundred, and the tribute to Yahweh was sixty-one;</verse>
    <verse num="40">the humans<note>Hebrew "human"</note> were sixteen thousand, and the tribute to Yahweh <transChange type="added">was</transChange> thirty-two persons.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And Moses gave away the tribute of the contribution of Yahweh to Eleazar the priest, just as Yahweh commanded Moses. </verse>
    <verse num="42">From the half of the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> which Moses divided from the men who were fighting,</verse>
    <verse num="43">the half that belonged to the community was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred from the flock,</verse>
    <verse num="44">and thirty-six thousand cattle,</verse>
    <verse num="45">and thirty thousand five hundred male donkeys,</verse>
    <verse num="46">and sixteen thousand humans.<note>Hebrew "human"</note></verse>
    <verse num="47">From the half that belonged to the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> Moses took one share drawn by lot out of every fifty humans<note>Hebrew "human"</note> and domestic animals, and he gave them to the Levites, who keep the responsibility of the tabernacle of Yahweh, just as Yahweh commanded Moses. </verse>
    <verse num="48">Then the leaders of the thousands of the army, the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, approached Moses,</verse>
    <verse num="49">and they said to Moses, "Your servants have {taken count}<note>Literally "lifted up the head"</note> of the men of war who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> {in our charge},<note>Literally "in our hand"</note> and no man is missing from us.</verse>
    <verse num="50">So we brought the offering of Yahweh, what each man found, objects of gold, bangles,<note>Hebrew "bangle"</note> bracelets,<note>Hebrew "bracelet"</note> rings,<note>Hebrew "ring"</note> earrings,<note>Hebrew "earring"</note> and female ornaments,<note>Hebrew "ornament"</note> to make atonement for ourselves {before}<note>Literally "in the presence of"</note> Yahweh."</verse>
    <verse num="51">Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all objects of work.</verse>
    <verse num="52">All the gold of the contribution that they raised up to Yahweh, from the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.</verse>
    <verse num="53">The men of battle plundered each for himself.</verse>
    <verse num="54">So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the commanders of the thousands and hundreds, and they brought it to the tent of the assembly as a memorial for the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> before Yahweh. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="32">
    <verse num="1">The descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Reuben and the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Gad had a very large number of livestock. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold it <transChange type="added">was</transChange> a place for livestock.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Gad and the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Reuben came, and they said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="3">"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,</verse>
    <verse num="4">the land that Yahweh struck before the community of Israel, <transChange type="added">is</transChange> a land of livestock, and your servants have livestock."</verse>
    <verse num="5">They said, "If we have found favor in {your sight},<note>Literally "your eyes"</note> let this land be given to your servants as property; do not lead us <transChange type="added">across</transChange> the Jordan." </verse>
    <verse num="6">But Moses said to the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Gad and to the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Reuben, "Will your brothers go to war while you yourselves live here?</verse>
    <verse num="7">Why are you discouraging the hearts of the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> from crossing into the land that Yahweh gave to them?</verse>
    <verse num="8">This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.</verse>
    <verse num="9">When they went up to the valley<note>Or "the wadi"</note> of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> so that they did not come to the land that Yahweh gave to them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So {Yahweh's anger burned}<note>Literally "Yahweh's nose became hot"</note> on that day, and he swore an oath, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="11">'The men who went up from Egypt, from {those twenty years old}<note>Literally "a son of twenty years"</note> and above, will not see the land that I swore with an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob because they have not wholly followed me,</verse>
    <verse num="12">except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, because they followed Yahweh wholly.'</verse>
    <verse num="13">And {Yahweh became angry},<note>Literally "Yahweh's nose became hot"</note> and he made them wander in the desert forty years until the entire generation who did evil in the {sight of Yahweh}<note>Literally "eyes of Yahweh"</note> {had died}.<note>Literally "had completed"</note></verse>
    <verse num="14">Behold, you stand in the place of your fathers, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more {Yahweh's fierce anger}<note>Literally "the fierce anger of Yahweh's nose"</note> against Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="15">If you turn from following him, he will again abandon them<note>Hebrew "him"</note> in the wilderness, and you would have destroyed all these people." </verse>
    <verse num="16">They came near to him and said, "We will build sheep pens here for <transChange type="added">the</transChange> flock of our livestock and cities for our little children;</verse>
    <verse num="17">but we ourselves will become armed <transChange type="added">and</transChange> ready before the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> until we have brought them to their place, and our little children will live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="18">We will not return to our houses until the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> each obtain their<note>Hebrew "his"</note> inheritance for themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="19">For we will not take possession with them from across the Jordan and beyond because our inheritance has come to us from across the Jordan to the east." </verse>
    <verse num="20">So Moses said to them, "If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves {before}<note>Literally "in the presence of"</note> Yahweh for the war,</verse>
    <verse num="21">and everyone of you armed cross the Jordan {before}<note>Literally "in the presence of"</note> Yahweh until he has driven out his enemies from before him,</verse>
    <verse num="22">and the land is subdued {before}<note>Literally "in the presence of"</note> Yahweh, then afterward you will return and be free of obligation from Yahweh and from Israel, and this land will be your property {before}<note>Literally "in the presence of"</note> Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse num="23">But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh, and know that your sin will find you.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Build for yourselves cities for your little children and sheep pens for your flocks; what has gone out from your mouth you will do." </verse>
    <verse num="25">So the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Gad and the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Reuben said to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do just as my lord commands.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Our little children, our wives, our livestock, and all of our animals<note>Hebrew "animal"</note> {will remain}<note>Literally "will be there"</note> in the cities of Gilead,</verse>
    <verse num="27">but your servants, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross over {before}<note>Literally "in the presence of"</note> Yahweh to the war, just as my lord says." </verse>
    <verse num="28">So Moses commanded them, Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the {families}<note>Literally "fathers"</note> of the tribes of the {Israelites}.<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note></verse>
    <verse num="29">Moses said to them, "If the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Gad and the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Reuben, everyone who is armed for the war, cross over the Jordan {before}<note>Literally "in the presence of"</note> Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, you will give them the land of Gilead as property.</verse>
    <verse num="30">But if they will not cross over with you armed, they will acquire land in your midst in Canaan."</verse>
    <verse num="31">The descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Gad and the descendants of Reuben answered and said, "What Yahweh has commanded your servants, we will do.</verse>
    <verse num="32">We ourselves will cross over armed {before}<note>Literally "in the presence of"</note> Yahweh to the land of Canaan, and the property of our inheritance <transChange type="added">will remain</transChange> with us beyond the Jordan." </verse>
    <verse num="33">So Moses gave to them, to the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Gad and the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Reuben, and to half of the tribe of Joseph's son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon the king of Amorites and the kingdom of Og the king of the Bashan, the land with its cities <transChange type="added">and their</transChange> territories, the cities of the surrounding land.</verse>
    <verse num="34">The descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, and Aroer,</verse>
    <verse num="35">and Atroth Shophan, Jazer, and Jogbehah,</verse>
    <verse num="36">and Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, the cities of Mibzar, and the sheep pens for flocks.</verse>
    <verse num="37">The descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,</verse>
    <verse num="38">and Nebo, Baal Meon (their names<note>Hebrew "name"</note> <transChange type="added">were</transChange> changed), and Sibmah, and {they renamed}<note>Literally "they called to names the names"</note> the cities that they rebuilt.</verse>
    <verse num="39">The descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and they captured it and drove out the Amorites<note>Hebrew "Amorite"</note> who <transChange type="added">were</transChange> in it.</verse>
    <verse num="40">So Moses gave Gilead to Makir son of Manasseh, and he lived in it.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their unwalled villages, and he called them Havvoth Jair.</verse>
    <verse num="42">Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah after his <transChange type="added">own</transChange> name. </verse>

    <verse num="50">Then Yahweh spoke to Moses on the desert-plateau of Moab by <transChange type="added">the</transChange> Jordan <transChange type="added">across</transChange> Jericho, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="51">"Speak to the {Israelites}<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> and say to them, 'When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,</verse>
    <verse num="52">you will drive out the inhabitants of the land from your presence, and you will destroy all their idols and all the images of their molten idols, and you will demolish all their high places;</verse>
    <verse num="53">you will dispossess the land and live in it because I have given the land to you to possess it.</verse>
    <verse num="54">You will distribute the land by lot according to your clans; to the larger group you will give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller group you will give less inheritance. However the lot falls for him, there the lot will be. You will distribute it according to the tribes of your ancestors.<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="55">But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from your presence, then it will happen that whomever you let remain of them will be like irritants in your eyes and like thorns in your sides; they will be your enemies in the land in which you live.</verse>
    <verse num="56">And just as I planned to do <transChange type="added">to</transChange> them, I will do to you.'" </verse>

    <verse num="1">Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="2">And they said, "Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land by lot as an inheritance to the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But if they become wives to one of the sons from <transChange type="added">another</transChange> tribe of the {Israelites},<note>Literally "sons/children of Israel"</note> their inheritance will disappear from the inheritance of our ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; the lot of our inheritance would disappear.</verse>
