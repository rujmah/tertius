    <verse num="8">Look, I have set the land {before you};<note>Literally "before your face"</note> go and take possession of the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give <transChange type="added">it</transChange> to them and to their offspring after them.' </verse>

    <verse num="11">Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note> may he add to you as you are <transChange type="added">now</transChange> a thousand times, and may he bless you just as he {promised you}.<note>Literally "spoke to you"</note></verse>

    <verse num="16">And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, '{hear out your fellow men},<note>Literally "hear between your brothers," with the idea of listening carefully in this context</note> and <transChange type="added">then</transChange> judge fairly<note>Or "righteously"</note> between a man and between his brother and between {his opponent who is a resident alien}.<note>Literally "between his resident alien/non-Israelite who dwells temporarily among Israel"</note></verse>

    <verse num="18">And so I instructed you at that time <transChange type="added">concerning</transChange> all <transChange type="added">of</transChange> the things that you should do. </verse>
    <verse num="19">"Then we set out from Horeb, and we went <transChange type="added">through</transChange> the whole <transChange type="added">of</transChange> that great and terrible desert that you saw <transChange type="added">on</transChange> the way <transChange type="added">to</transChange> the hill country of the Amorites<note>Hebrew "Amorite"</note> as Yahweh our God had commanded us, and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> we came up to Kadesh Barnea.</verse>
    <verse num="20">I said to you, '{You have reached}<note>Literally "You have come up to"</note> the hill country of the Amorites<note>Hebrew "Amorite"</note> that Yahweh our God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> giving to us.</verse>
    <verse num="21">See, Yahweh your God has set before you the land; go up and possess <transChange type="added">it</transChange> as Yahweh the God of your ancestors<note>Or "fathers"</note> said to you; do not fear and do not be dismayed.' </verse>
    <verse num="22">"Then all of you approached me, and <transChange type="added">you</transChange> said, 'Let us send men {before us},<note>Literally "before our faces" or "ahead of us"</note> and let them explore the land for us, and let them bring back {a report}<note>Literally "a word"</note> to us <transChange type="added">concerning</transChange> the way that {we should take}<note>Literally "we should go up by it"</note> <transChange type="added">and concerning</transChange> the cities that we shall come to.'</verse>
    <verse num="23">The plan was good {in my opinion},<note>Literally "in my eyes"</note> and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> I took from <transChange type="added">among</transChange> you twelve men, {one from each tribe}.<note>Literally "man one from the tribe"</note></verse>
    <verse num="24">And they {set out}<note>Literally "turned"</note> and {went up into the hill country},<note>Literally "went up toward the hill <transChange type="added">country</transChange> mountain"</note> and they went up to the wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> of Eschol, and they spied out <transChange type="added">the land</transChange>.</verse>
    <verse num="25">They took in their hands<note>Hebrew "hand"</note> {some of the fruit}<note>Literally "from the fruit"</note> of the land, and they brought <transChange type="added">it</transChange> down to us, and they brought to us back {a report},<note>Literally "a word"</note> and they said, 'The land that Yahweh our God <transChange type="added">is</transChange> giving to us <transChange type="added">is</transChange> good.'</verse>
    <verse num="26">But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the {command}<note>Literally "mouth"</note> of Yahweh your God.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And you grumbled in your tents, and you said, 'Because of the hatred of Yahweh <transChange type="added">toward</transChange> us he has brought us out from the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorites<note>Hebrew "Amorite"</note> to destroy us.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Where <transChange type="added">can</transChange> we go up?

' </verse>
    <verse num="29">"And so I said to you, 'Do not be terrified, and do not fear them.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Yahweh your God, who is going {before you},<note>Literally "to your faces"</note> will himself<note>The Hebrew pronoun indicates emphasis</note> fight for you, {just as}<note>Literally "like all that"</note> he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</verse>

    <verse num="32">But through all of this you did not trust in Yahweh your God,</verse>
    <verse num="33">{who goes}<note>Literally "<transChange type="added">is</transChange> the one going"</note> {before you}<note>Literally "before your faces"</note> on your<note>Hebrew "the"</note> way, seeking a place for your encampment, in fire at night and in a cloud by day, to show you the way that {you should go}.<note>Literally "you should go in it"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="34">"Then Yahweh heard the sound of your words, and he was angry, and he swore, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note></verse>
    <verse num="35">'No one of these men<note>The beginning of an oath in Hebrew; the text emphatically denies anyone of that evil generation the privilege of seeing the promised land</note> of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,<note>Or "fathers"</note></verse>
    <verse num="36">except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himself<note>Emphatic use of the pronoun</note> shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has trodden and to his sons<note>Or "descendants"</note> because {he followed Yahweh unreservedly}.'<note>Literally "he filled <transChange type="added">his hands</transChange> after Yahweh"</note></verse>
    <verse num="37">Even with me Yahweh was angry because of you, saying, 'Not even you shall enter there.</verse>
    <verse num="38">Joshua, the son of Nun, {your assistant},<note>Literally "the one standing before you"</note> will go there; encourage him because he will cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And your little children, who you thought shall become plunder, and your sons, who do not today know good or bad, shall themselves<note>The Hebrew pronoun is used for emphasis</note> go there, and I will give it to them, and they shall take possession of it.</verse>
    <verse num="40">But you turn and set out <transChange type="added">in the direction of</transChange> the wilderness by way of the {Red Sea}.'<note>Literally "sea of reeds"</note> </verse>
    <verse num="41">"You replied and said to me, 'We have sinned against Yahweh, <transChange type="added">and now</transChange> we will go up and fight according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us'; and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> each man fastened on {his battle gear},<note>Literally "his vessels of battle"</note> and you regarded <transChange type="added">it</transChange> as easy to go up <transChange type="added">into</transChange> the hill country.</verse>
    <verse num="42">So Yahweh said to me, 'Say to them, "You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated {before}<note>Literally "in the faces of your enemies"</note> your enemies." '</verse>
    <verse num="43">So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the {command of Yahweh};<note>Literally "mouth of Yahweh"</note> you behaved presumptuously, and you went up into the hill country.</verse>
    <verse num="44">The Amorites living in the hill country went out {to oppose you}<note>Literally "to meet you"</note> and chased you as <transChange type="added">a swarm of</transChange> wild honey bees do; and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> they {beat}<note>Literally "cut"</note> you down in Seir as far as Hormah.</verse>
    <verse num="45">So you returned and wept {before Yahweh};<note>Literally "before the faces of Yahweh"</note> but Yahweh did not listen to your voice and did not pay <transChange type="added">any</transChange> attention to you.</verse>
    <verse num="46">You stayed in Kadesh many days; such were the days that you stayed <transChange type="added">there</transChange>. </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">"<transChange type="added">Then</transChange> we turned and set out <transChange type="added">toward</transChange> the wilderness<note>Or "desert"</note> in the direction of the {Red Sea},<note>Literally "sea of reeds"</note> as Yahweh told me, and we went around Mount Seir <transChange type="added">for</transChange> many days.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Yahweh spoke to me, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note></verse>
    <verse num="3">'<transChange type="added">Long</transChange> enough you have been skirting this mountain; turn yourselves north,</verse>
    <verse num="4">and instruct<note>Or "command"</note> the people, {saying},<note>Literally "to say"</note> "You <transChange type="added">are</transChange> about to cross <transChange type="added">through</transChange> the territory of your brothers, the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Esau, who are living in Seir; they will be afraid of you, and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> be very careful.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Do not get involved in battle<note>Or "provoke"</note> with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even {a foot's breadth}<note>Literally "a sole's foot of space"</note> <transChange type="added">of it</transChange>; since I have given Mount Seir <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a possession for Esau.</verse>
    <verse num="6">You shall buy food from them so that you may eat; and also you shall purchase water from them with money so that you may drink.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The fact of the matter is, Yahweh your God has blessed you in {all the work you have done};<note>Literally "the work of your hand"</note> he knows {your travels}<note>Literally "your journeying"</note> <transChange type="added">with respect to</transChange> this great wilderness; forty years Yahweh your God <transChange type="added">has been</transChange> with you; you have not lacked a thing." '</verse>
    <verse num="8">And so we passed by our brothers, the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Esau, who live in Seir, past the road of the Arabah,<note>Or "Jordan Valley" since the Arabah is an extension of it</note> from Elath and Ezion Geber, and we turned and traveled along the route of the desert<note>Or "wilderness"</note> of Moab. </verse>
    <verse num="9">And Yahweh said to me, 'You shall not attack Moab, and you shall not engage in war<note>Or "battle"</note> with them, for I will not give you any of his land <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a possession; I have given Ar to the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Lot <transChange type="added">as</transChange> a possession.'</verse>
    <verse num="10">(The Emim previously lived in it, a people large,<note>Or "great" in the sense of influential</note> numerous, and tall, like the Anakites.</verse>

    <verse num="12">The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants<note>Or "sons"</note> of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them {from among themselves},<note>Literally "from their presence"</note> as Israel did with respect to the land of their<note>Literally "its/his"</note> possession that Yahweh gave to them.)</verse>
    <verse num="13">So <transChange type="added">now</transChange> arise and cross over the wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> of Zered yourselves; and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> we crossed the wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> of Zered.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Now the {length of time}<note>Literally "days"</note> that we had traveled from Kadesh Barnea until <transChange type="added">the time when</transChange> we crossed the wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> of Zered <transChange type="added">was</transChange> thirty-eight years, until the perishing of all of that generation; <transChange type="added">that is</transChange>, the men of war from the midst of the camp as Yahweh had sworn to them.</verse>
    <verse num="15">The hand of Yahweh was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely. </verse>

    <verse num="23">And <transChange type="added">also</transChange> the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, <transChange type="added">and the</transChange> Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and <transChange type="added">then</transChange> settled in their place.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Arise,<note>Or "Get up"</note> set out and cross <transChange type="added">over</transChange> the wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> of Arnon.

    <verse num="25">This day I will begin to place {the dread of you}<note>Literally "your dread"</note> and the fear of you {before}<note>Literally "upon the faces of"</note> the peoples under all the heavens. <transChange type="added">They</transChange> will hear {the report about you},<note>Literally "your report"</note> and <transChange type="added">so</transChange> they will shake and tremble {because of you}.' <note>Literally "from before you"</note> </verse>
