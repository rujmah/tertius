    <verse num="1">The elder, to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in <transChange type="added">the</transChange> truth.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Dear friend, I pray you may prosper concerning everything and be healthy, just as your soul prospers.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For I rejoiced exceedingly <transChange type="added">when the</transChange><note>*Here "<transChange type="added">when</transChange>" is supplied as a component of the participle ("came") which is understood as temporal</note> brothers came and testified <transChange type="added">to</transChange> your truth, just as you are walking in <transChange type="added">the</transChange> truth.</verse>
    <verse num="4">I have no greater joy than this: that I hear my children are walking in the truth. </verse>
    <verse num="5">Dear friend, you act faithfully<note>Or "you act loyally"</note> <transChange type="added">in</transChange> whatever you do for the brothers, {even though they are strangers}<note>Literally "and this strangers"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="6">They have testified <transChange type="added">to</transChange> your love before the church; you will do well to send them<note>Literally "whom"</note> on their way in a manner worthy of God.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For they have gone out on behalf of the name, accepting nothing from the pagans.<note>That is, Gentile unbelievers (as opposed to Gentile Christians)</note></verse>
    <verse num="8">Therefore we ought to support such <transChange type="added">people</transChange>, so that we become fellow workers with <transChange type="added">the</transChange> truth. </verse>
    <verse num="9">I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who wants to be first <transChange type="added">among</transChange> them, does not acknowledge us.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to {the deeds he is doing}<note>Literally "his deeds which he is doing"</note>, disparaging us with evil words. And not being content with these, he does not receive the brothers himself, and he hinders those wanting <transChange type="added">to do so</transChange> and throws <transChange type="added">them</transChange> out of the church.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Dear friend, do not imitate <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> evil, but <transChange type="added">what is</transChange> good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God. </verse>
    <verse num="12">Demetrius has been testified to by all, even by the truth itself. And we also testify <transChange type="added">to him</transChange>, and you know that our testimony is true. </verse>
    <verse num="13">I have many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you by means of ink and pen.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But I hope to see you right away, and to speak {face to face}<note>Literally "mouth to mouth"</note>.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Peace <transChange type="added">be</transChange> to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
